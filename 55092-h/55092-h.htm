  <h2 class='c005'>SOMERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>John Somers was born at Worcester, in an ancient house called the
White Ladies, which, as its name seems to import, had formerly been
part of a monastery or convent. The exact date of his birth cannot
be ascertained, as the parish registers at Worcester, during the civil
wars between Charles I. and his Parliament, were either wholly lost, or
so inaccurately kept as not to furnish any authentic information. It
appears probable, however, from several concurring accounts, that
he was born about the year 1650. The family of Somers was respectable,
though not wealthy, and had for several generations been
possessed of an estate at Clifton, in the parish of Severnstoke, in
Gloucestershire. Admiral Sir George Somers, who in the reign of
James I. was shipwrecked on the Bermudas, and afterwards died
there, leaving his name to that cluster of islands, is said by Horace
Walpole, in his âCatalogue of Royal and Noble Authors,â to have
been a member of the same family. The father of Somers was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>attorney, in respectable practice at Worcester; who, in the civil wars,
became a zealous Parliamentarian, and commanded a troop in Cromwellâs
army.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the early education of Somers, we have only a meagre and
unsatisfactory account. The house called the White Ladies, in which
he was born, was occupied by a Mr. Blurton, an eminent clothier of
Worcester, who had married his fatherâs sister. This lady, having no
son of her own, adopted Somers from his birth, and brought him
up in her house, which he always considered as his home till he
went to the university. He appears for some years to have been a day-scholar
in the college-school at Worcester, which before his time had
attained a high character for classical education, under the superintendence
of Dr. Bright, a clergyman of great learning and eminence.
At a subsequent period, we find him at a private school at Walsall in
Staffordshire: he is described by a school-fellow as being then âa
weakly boy, wearing a black cap, and never so much as looking out
when the other boys were at play.â He seems indeed to have been a
remarkably reserved and âsober-bloodedâ boy. At a somewhat later
period Sir F. Winnington says of him, that âby the exactness of his
knowledge and behaviour, he discouraged his father and all the young
men that knew him. They were afraid to be in his company.â In
what manner his time was occupied from the period of his leaving
school until he went to the university, is unknown. It has been
suggested that he was employed for several years in his fatherâs
office, who designed him for his own department of the profession of
the law. There is no positive evidence of this circumstance, though
the conjecture is by no means improbable. It cannot, however, be
doubted that, during this period, he devoted much of his time to the
study of history and the civil law, and laid in a portion of that abundant
store of constitutional learning which afterwards rendered him the
ornament of his profession, and of the age in which he lived. About
this time also he formed several connexions, which had great influence
upon his subsequent success in life. The estates of the Earl of Shrewsbury
were managed by Somersâs father; and as that young nobleman
had no convenient residence of his own in Worcestershire, he spent
much of his time at the White Ladies, and formed an intimate friendship
and familiarity with young Somers. In 1672 he was also fortunate
enough to be favourably noticed by Sir Francis Winnington,
then a distinguished practitioner at the English bar, who was under
obligations to his father for his active services in promoting his election
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>as a Member of Parliament for the city of Worcester. Winnington is
described by Burnet as a lawyer who had ârisen from small beginnings,
and from as small a proportion of learning in his profession, in
which he was rather bold and ready, than able.â It is natural to suppose
that such a man, feeling his own deficiencies, would readily perceive
with what advantage he might employ the talents and industry
of Somers in assisting him both in Westminster Hall and in Parliament.
It was probably with this intention that Winnington advised
him to go to the university, and to prosecute his studies with a view to
being called to the bar.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1674 Somers was entered as a Commoner of Trinity College,
Oxford, being then about three and twenty years of age. The particulars
of his progress through the university are not recorded; but
here, as at school, his contemporaries could perceive few indications
of those splendid talents which afterwards raised him to such extraordinary
eminence. His college exercises, some of which are still
extant, are said to have been in no respect remarkable; and he quitted
the university without acquiring any academical honours beyond his
Bachelorâs degree. Mr. Somers was called to the bar in 1676, by the
Society of the Middle Temple; but he continued his residence at the
university for several years afterwards, and did not remove to London
until the year after his fatherâs death, in 1681, upon which event he
succeeded to his paternal estate at Severnstoke. During his residence
at Oxford he had the advantage of being introduced by the Earl of
Shrewsbury and Sir F. Winnington to many of the patriotic opponents
of the arbitrary measures of the Court. At this time he published
several tracts, which sufficiently displayed to the world his familiar and
accurate knowledge of constitutional history. His first acknowledged
work was the Report of an Election Case, and is entitled âThe
Memorable Case of Denzil Onslow, Esq., tried at the Assizes in Surrey,
July 20, 1681, touching his election at Haslemere in Surrey.â His
next performance was âA Brief History of the Succession, collected
out of the Records and the most authentic Historians.â This work
was written at the time when the proposal to bring in a Bill to exclude
the Duke of York from the succession occupied universal attention,
and excited the most intense interest. The object of Mr. Somersâs
tract was to exhibit the principles upon which the Parliament of England
has authority to alter, restrain, and qualify the right of succession
to the Crown; and he places the historical arguments in support of
this proposition in a forcible and convincing light. Indeed, though it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>might be difficult to justify such a proposition by abstract arguments
upon what is called the theory of the British Constitution, it has been
so repeatedly acted upon in several periods of our history, that even
in the time of Charles II. the practice had, as Somers justly contended,
to all intents and purposes established and sanctioned the
principle. An excellent tract upon the same subject, entitled âA just
and modest Vindication of the two last Parliaments,â which appeared
shortly after the breaking up of the Oxford Parliament in March,
1681, has been partly ascribed to Somers. Burnet says that this
tract, which he characterizes as âthe best writ paper in all that time,â
was at first penned by Algernon Sidney, but that a new draught was
made by Somers, which was corrected by Sir William Jones. Upon
occasion of the attempt of the Court party in 1681, by the illegal
examination of witnesses under the direction of the Kingâs Counsel
in open court, to induce a grand jury at the Old Bailey to find a true
bill for high treason against the Earl of Shaftsbury, Mr. Somers
wrote his celebrated tract entitled âThe Security of Englishmenâs
Lives, or the Trust, Power, and Duty of the Grand Juries of England
explained.â Of this work, Bishop Burnet says, âIt passed as writ by
Lord Essex, though I understood afterwards it was writ by Somers,
who was much esteemed, and often visited by Lord Essex, and who
trusted himself to him, and writ the best papers that came out in that
time.â In later times, this work has been universally ascribed to
Somers. During his residence at Oxford, Somers was not inattentive
to polite literature; he published a translation of some of Ovidâs Epistles
into English verse, which at the same time that it shows that he could
never have borne so distinguished a rank as a poet, as he afterwards
attained as a lawyer and statesman, is by no means a contemptible
performance. His translations from Ovid, and a version of Plutarchâs
Life of Alcibiades, are the only published proofs of his classical
studies at Oxford.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1682 he removed to London, and immediately commenced
an assiduous attendance upon the courts of law, which at that
time was considered as the highway of the legal profession. Under
the powerful patronage of Sir Francis Winnington, who had been
Solicitor-General, and was then in the full stream of business, he rose
with considerable rapidity into good practice at the bar. In 1683
he appeared as junior counsel to Winnington in the defence to an
important political prosecution instituted against Pilkington and Shute,
with several other persons, for a riot at the election of sheriffs for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the city of London. His employment in a case of so much public
expectation may be taken as a proof that at that time his professional
merits were in some degree appreciated; and in the reign of James II.
his practice is said to have produced Â£700 a-year, which at that time
was a very large income for a common lawyer of five yearsâ standing.
But such was the character for research and industry which he had
attained within a very few years from the commencement of his professional
career, that on the trial of the Seven Bishops in 1688, he was
introduced as counsel into that momentous cause at the express and
peremptory recommendation of Pollexfen, one of the greatest lawyers
of that day. The rank of the defendants, the personal interest of the
King in the question at issue, the general expectation excited by this
conflict amongst all classes of the people, and above all, the event of
the prosecution which drove James from his throne and kingdom, and
immediately introduced the Revolution of 1688, render the trial of the
Seven Bishops one of the most important judicial proceedings that ever
occurred in Westminster Hall. It was no trifling testimony, therefore,
to the high estimation in which Somers was held by experienced judges
of professional merit, that he should be expressly selected by the
counsel for the defendants to bear a part in the defence. We are told
that upon the first suggestion of Somersâs name, âobjection was made
amongst the Bishops to him, as too young and obscure a man; but old
Pollexfen insisted upon him, and would not be himself retained without
the other; representing him as the man who would take most pains
and go deepest into all that depended on precedents and records<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.â
How far the leading counsel for the Bishops were indebted to the
industry and research of Somers, for the extent of learning displayed
in their admirable arguments on that occasion, cannot now be ascertained;
his own speech, as reported in the State Trials, contains a
summary of the constitutional reasons against the existence of a dispensing
power in the King, expressed in clear and unaffected language,
and applied with peculiar skill and judgment to the defence of his
clients.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The intimate connexion of Somers with the leaders of that political
party by whom the Revolution was effected, and in particular with his
early friend Lord Shrewsbury, leaves little room for doubt that he was
actively employed in devising the means by which that important event
was brought about. It is said by Tindal that he was admitted into
the most secret councils of the Prince of Orange, and was one of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>who planned the measure of bringing him over to England. Immediately
upon the flight of James II., the Prince of Orange, by the
advice of the temporary assembly which he had convened as the most
proper representative of the people in the emergency of the time,
issued circular letters to the several counties, cities, and boroughs of
England, directing them to summon a Parliamentary Convention. On
this occasion Mr. Somers was returned as a representative by his
native city of Worcester. We find him taking a conspicuous part in
the long and laborious debates which took place in that assembly
respecting the settlement of the government. Upon a conference with
the Lords upon the resolution, âthat James II. having withdrawn
himself out of the kingdom had abdicated the government, and that
the throne had thereby become vacant,â Mr. Somers spoke at great
length, and with much learning, in support of the original resolution
against some amendments proposed by the Lords. This resolution
having been ultimately adopted by both Houses of Parliament, and the
Prince and Princess of Orange having been declared King and Queen
of England, a committee was appointed, of which Somers was a
member, to bring in heads of such things as were necessary for securing
the Protestant religion, the laws of the land, and the liberties of the
people. The Report of this Committee, which was a most elaborate
performance, having been submitted to the examination of a second
committee, of which Somers was chairman, formed the substance of
the Declaration of Rights which was afterwards assented to by the King
and Queen and both Houses of Parliament, and thus adopted as the
basis of the Constitution.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is impossible to ascertain with precision the particular services
rendered by Somers in the accomplishment of this great measure.
There was perhaps no individual at that moment in existence who was
so well qualified to lend important aid in conducting his country
with safety through the difficulties and dangers of a change of
government, and in placing the interests of the nation upon a secure
and solid foundation. Fortunate was it for the people of England and
their posterity that the services of a man of his industry and settled
principles, of his sound constitutional information, and his rational
and enlightened views of the relative rights and duties of kings and
subjects, were at that critical juncture available to his country; and
that, at the instant of the occurrence of this momentous revolution,
his character was sufficiently known and appreciated to render those
services fully effective.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Shortly after the accession of William and Mary, Somers was
appointed Solicitor-General, and received the honour of knighthood.
Bishop Burnet says, that in the warm debates which took place in
Parliament on the bill respecting the recognition of the King and
Queen, and the validity of the new settlement of the government,
it was strongly objected by the Tories that the convention, not being
summoned by the Kingâs writ, had no legal sanction; and that Somers
distinguished himself by the spirited and able manner in which
he answered the objection. âHe spoke,â says Burnet, âwith such
zeal and such an ascendant of authority that none were prepared to
answer it; so that the bill passed without more opposition. This was
a great service done in a very critical time, and contributed not a little
to raise Somersâs character.â</p>

<p class='c000'>In April, 1692, Sir John Somers became Attorney-General, and in
the month of March following was appointed Lord-Keeper of the
Great Seal. While he presided in the Court of Chancery as Lord-Keeper,
he delivered his celebrated judgment in the Bankersâ case,
which Mr. Hargrave describes as âone of the most elaborate arguments
ever delivered in Westminster Hall.â It is said that Lord
Somers expended several hundred pounds in collecting books and
pamphlets for this argument. In 1697 he was appointed Lord Chancellor,
and raised to the peerage, with the title of Baron Somers of
Evesham.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year immediately succeeding his elevation to the peerage, it
was the fate of Lord Somers to experience the virulence of party
animosity, and the selfishness and instability of royal favour. His
influence with the King, and the moderation and good sense with
which he had restrained the impetuosity of his own party, had been
long the means of preserving the Whig administration; and the Tories
saw plainly that there were no hopes for the attainment of their
objects so long as Lord Somers retained the confidence of the King.
William had been, from the commencement of his reign, continually
vacillating between the two parties according to the circumstances of
his affairs; at this period he was so incensed and embarrassed by the
conduct of the contending parties in the House of Commons, that he
readily listened to the leaders of the Tories, who assured him that they
would undertake to manage the Parliament as he pleased, if he would
dismiss from his councils the Lord Chancellor Somers, whom they
represented to be peculiarly odious to the Commons. In fact, the
Tory party in the House of Commons had, in the course of the stormy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>session of Parliament which commenced in November, 1699, made
several violent but ineffectual attacks upon the Lord Chancellor. The
first charge brought against him was, that he had improperly dismissed
many gentlemen from the commission of the peace: upon a full explanation
of all the circumstances, this charge was proved to be so utterly
groundless that it was abandoned by those who had introduced it.
The second accusation had no better foundation than the first. Great
complaints having been made of certain English pirates in the West
Indies, who had plundered several merchant ships, it was determined to
send out a ship of war for the purpose of destroying them. But as
there was no fund to bear the charge of such an expedition, the King
proposed to his ministers that it should be carried on as a private
undertaking, and promised to subscribe Â£3,000 on his own account.
In compliance with this recommendation, Lord Somers, the Duke of
Shrewsbury, the Earls of Romney, Oxford, Bellamont, and several
others, contributed a sufficient sum to defray the whole expense of the
armament. Unfortunately one Captain Kidd was appointed to command
the expedition, who was unprincipled enough to turn pirate himself,
and having committed various acts of robbery on the high seas,
was eventually captured, brought to England, and some time afterwards
tried and executed for his offences. It was then insinuated that the Lord
Chancellor and the other individuals who had subscribed towards the
expedition were engaged as partners in Kiddâs piratical scheme; so that
an undertaking, which was not only innocent, but meritorious and
patriotic, was construed by the blindness of party prejudice into a
design for robbery and piracy. A resolution in the House of Commons,
founded upon this absurd imputation, was rejected by a great
majority. Shortly afterwards, after ordering a list of the Privy
Council to be laid before the House, a question was moved in the
House of Commons, âthat an address should be made to his Majesty
to remove John Lord Somers, Chancellor of England, from his presence
and councils for ever.â This motion, however, was also negatived by a
large majority. The prosecution of these frivolous charges against Lord
Somers was a source of perpetual irritation to the King, in consequence
of the vexatious delay it occasioned to the public service, and
the virulent party spirit which it introduced into the House of Commons;
and it was under the influence of this feeling, and in order to
deliver himself from a temporary embarrassment, that he selfishly
determined to adopt the interested advice of the Tory leaders, and to
remove the Lord Chancellor from his office. He accordingly intimated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>to Lord Somers that it was necessary for his service that he should
resign the seals, but wished him to make the resignation himself, in
order that it might appear as if it was his own act. The Chancellor
declined to make a voluntary surrender of the seals, as such a course
might indicate a fear of his enemies, or a consciousness of misconduct
in his office; upon which Lord Jersey was sent with an express warrant
for the seals, and Lord Somers delivered them to him without
hesitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The malignity of party spirit was not satisfied by the dismissal of
Lord Somers from his office, and from all participation in the government.
Soon after his retirement, namely in the year 1701, the
celebrated Partition Treaties gave occasion to much angry debate in
both Houses of Parliament. His conduct, with respect to these
treaties, seems to have been entirely irreproachable; but it became the
subject of much misrepresentation, and the most unreserved invective
and abuse in the House of Commons. It appears that in 1698, when
the King was in Holland, a proposal was made to him by the French
Government for arranging the partition of some of the territories
belonging to the crown of Spain upon the expected death of Charles II.
This partition was to be made in certain defined proportions between
the Electoral Prince of Bavaria, the Dauphin of France, and the
Archduke Charles, the second son of the Emperor. The King entertained
these proposals favourably, and wrote to Lord Somers, who was
at that time Lord Chancellor, desiring his opinion upon them, and
commanding him to forward to him a commission in blank under the
great seal, appointing persons to treat with the Commissioners of the
French Government. Lord Somers, after communicating with Lord
Orford, the Duke of Shrewsbury, and Mr. Mountague, as he had been
authorized to do, transmitted to the King their joint opinions, which
suggested several objections to the proposed treaty, together with the
required commission. This was the âhead and front of his offendingâ
in this respect; for the treaty was afterwards negotiated abroad, and
finally signed without any further communication with Lord Somers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Understanding that he was accused in the House of Commons of
having advised and promoted the Partition Treaties, Lord Somers
requested to be heard in that House in his defence. His request being
granted, he stated to the House, in a calm and dignified manner, the
history of his conduct respecting the treaties, and contended, with much
force and eloquence, that in the whole course of that transaction he
had correctly and honestly discharged his duty both as Chancellor and
as a Privy Councillor. After he had withdrawn, a warm debate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>ensued, which terminated in a resolution, carried by a small majority,
âthat John, Lord Somers, by advising his Majesty to conclude the
Treaty of Partition, was guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour.â
Similar resolutions were passed against the Earl of Orford and Lord
Halifax, and all of them were impeached at the bar of the House of
Lords. The articles of impeachment against Lord Somers principally
charged him with having affixed the great seal to the blank commission
sent to the King in Holland, and afterwards to the treaties; with
having encouraged and promoted the piracies of Captain Kidd; and
with having received grants from the Crown for his own personal
emolument. To each of these articles Lord Somers answered
promptly and fully; to the two first he replied the facts of each case
as above related; and in answer to the third, he admitted that the
King had been pleased to make certain grants to him, but denied
that they had been made in consequence of any solicitation on his part.
After many frivolous delays and repeated disputes between the two
Houses, a day was fixed for the trial of the impeachment; on which
day the Commons not appearing to prosecute their articles, the Lords,
by a considerable majority, acquitted Lord Somers of the charges and
dismissed the impeachment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The violence and folly exhibited in the conduct of these proceedings
opened the eyes of the King to his error in having changed
his ministry at so critical a time. He found to his infinite disquietude
that instead of enabling him to manage the Commons as they had
promised, the Tory leaders had rendered them more intractable and
imperious than before; and that instead of sincerely endeavouring to
promote peace abroad and quiet government at home, they were
actuated entirely by motives of private passion and revenge. In this
state of affairs he again directed his attention to Lord Somers, in consequence,
probably, of the urgent advice of Lord Sunderland, and
wrote him a note from Loo, dated the 10th of October, 1701, assuring
him of the continuance of his friendship. By the united exertions of
Somers and Sunderland a negotiation was entered into with a view to
the formation of a Whig ministry; but after some little progress had
been made, the death of the King, in March 1702, put an end to the
project, and the succession of Queen Anne confirmed the establishment
of the Tory administration.</p>

<p class='c000'>The state of parties for some years after the accession of Queen
Anne excluded Somers from taking any active part in political affairs.
It is probable that at this period of his life he devoted his attention
to literature and science, as in 1702 he was elected President of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Royal Society. He afterwards applied himself with diligence to the
removal of several gross defects in the practice of the Courts of Chancery
and Common Law. In 1706 he introduced into the House of Lords
an extensive and effectual bill for the correction of such abuses. In
passing through the House of Commons âit was found,â says Burnet,
âthat the interest of under-officers, clerks, and attorneys, whose gains
were to be lessened by this bill, was more considered than the interest
of the nation itself. Several clauses, how beneficial soever to the
subject, which touched on their profit, were left out by the Commons.â
Still the Act âfor the Amendment of the Law and the better advancement
of Justice,â as it now stands amongst the statutes of the realm,
effected a very important improvement in the administration of justice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Somers is said to have had a chief hand in projecting the
scheme of the Union with Scotland; and in discussing and arranging
the details of this great measure in the House of Lords, he appears to
have been one of the most frequent and distinguished speakers, though
he was then labouring under great bodily infirmity.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1708, on occasion of the temporary return of the Whigs
to power, Lord Somers again formed part of the administration and
filled the office of President of the Council. But the powers of his
mind were at this time much enfeebled by continual ill-health; and it
was probably with feelings of satisfaction that the change of parties in
1710, by causing his dismissal from office, enabled him finally to retire
into private life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the mode in which the remaining period of his life was spent
after his removal from public business, little is known. There is,
however, no doubt that the concluding years of his existence were
darkened by much sickness and some degree of mental alienation
on the accession of George I. he formally took his seat at the
Council-Board; but a paralytic affection, which had destroyed his
bodily health, had so impaired the faculties of his mind as to incapacitate
him entirely for business. At intervals, however, when the
pressure of disease was suspended, he appears to have recurred
with strong interest to passing events in which the welfare of his
country was involved. When the Septennial Bill was in progress,
Lord Townshend called upon him: Lord Somers embraced him,
congratulated him on the progress of the bill, and declared that
âhe thought it would be the greatest support possible to the liberty
of the country.â On a subsequent occasion, when informed by the
same nobleman of the determination of George I. to adopt the advice
of his ministry, by executing the full rigour of the law against Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Derwentwater, and the other unfortunate persons concerned in the
Rebellion of 1715, he is said to have asked with great emotion, and
shedding many tears, âwhether they meant to revive the proscriptions
of Marius and Sylla?â</p>

<p class='c000'>He soon afterwards sunk into a state of total imbecility, from which,
on the 26th of April, 1716, he was happily released by death.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>SMEATON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>John Smeaton will long be remembered as one of the most laborious
and most successful civil engineers whom Britain has produced: a
class to which our country is deeply indebted for its commercial greatness.
He was born at Austhorpe, near Leeds, May 28, 1724. His
father was an attorney, and intended to bring his son up to his own
profession: but the latter finding, to use his own words, âthat the
law did not suit the bent of his genius,â obtained his parentâs consent
that he should seek a more congenial employment.</p>

<p class='c000'>From a very early age he had shown great fondness for mechanical
occupations. âHis playthings,â it is said by one long acquainted
with him, âwere not the playthings of children, but the tools men
work with; and he appeared to have greater entertainment in seeing
the men in the neighbourhood work, and asking them questions, than
in any thing else.â At the age of eighteen he was in the habit of
forging iron and steel, and melting metal for his own use: and
he possessed tools of every sort for working in wood, ivory, and metal.
Some of these were of his own construction; and among them an
engine for rose-turning, and a lathe by which he had cut a perpetual
screw, a thing little known at that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1750 he established himself in the Great Turnstile in
Holborn, as a philosophical instrument-maker. While he followed this
trade, he became known to the scientific circles by several ingenious
inventions; among which were a new kind of magnetic compass,
and a machine for measuring a shipâs way at sea. He was elected
fellow of the Royal Society in 1753; and contributed several papers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>to the Philosophical Transactions, one of which, entitled âAn Experimental
Enquiry concerning the natural powers of water and wind to
turn mills and other machines, depending on a circular motion,â
obtained the gold medal in 1759.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1755 the Eddystone light-house was destroyed by fire. At this
time Smeaton had never practised as an architect or engineer. But the
proprietors, to use his own words, âconsidered that to reinstate it would
require, not so much a person who had been merely bred, or who had
rendered himself eminent in this or that given profession, but rather
one who from natural genius had a turn for contrivance in the
mechanical branches of science.â Thinking thus, they applied to the
President of the Royal Society to recommend a fitting person, and he
without hesitation named Smeaton. We shall speak hereafter of the
difficulties which attended this work, and the method of its execution;
the nature of it is familiar to every reader. Two light-houses had
been destroyed within half a century: his own, after the lapse of
seventy-three years, stands unimpaired;âa proud monument of the
power of man to overcome the elements. This building was finished
in 1759, and established his reputation as a civil engineer: but it was
some time before he devoted his attention solely to practising in that
capacity. In 1764 he was appointed one of the Receivers of the
Greenwich Hospital Estates, and in the discharge of his duty, he
suggested various improvements which were of material service to
the property. He resigned that office about 1777, in consequence of
the increase of his other business. In 1766 he was employed to
furnish designs for new light-houses at the Spurn Head, at the mouth
of the Humber, and after considerable delay, was appointed Surveyor
of the Works in 1771. These were completed in April, 1777.
Among other undertakings he repaired and improved the navigation of
the river Calder; he built the bridge over the Tay, at Perth, and some
others on the Highland road, north of Inverness; he laid out the line,
and superintended the execution of a considerable portion of the great
canal connecting the Forth and Clyde. His high reputation was shown
shortly after the two centre arches of old London bridge had been thrown
into one. The foundations of the piers were discovered to be damaged,
and the danger of the bridge was esteemed so imminent that few persons
would venture to pass over it. The opinions of the architects on
the spot were deemed unsatisfactory; and Smeaton, being at the time
in Yorkshire, was summoned by express, to say what should be done.
He found that the increased volume of water passing through the centre
arch had undermined the piers; and removed the danger by the simple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>expedient, the success of which he had proved on the river Calder, of
throwing in a large quantity of rough stone about them. The interstices
of the heap soon are filled up by sand and mud, and the whole
is consolidated almost into one mass, and forms a secure and lasting
barrier. The best known of Smeatonâs works, after the Eddystone
light-house, is the magnificent pier and harbour of Ramsgate. This
undertaking was commenced in 1749, and prosecuted for some time
with very imperfect success. In 1774 Smeaton was called in; and
he continued to superintend the progress of the works till their completion
in 1791. The harbour is now enclosed by two piers, the
eastern nearly 2000, the western 1500 feet in length, and affords a safe
and a much needed refuge to ships lying in the Downs, even of five
and six hundred tons, which before, when driven from their anchors by
stress of weather, were almost certain to be cast ashore and wrecked.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be vain to enumerate all the projects in which he was consulted,
or the schemes which he executed. The variety and extent of
his employments may be best estimated from his Reports, of which
a complete collection has been published by the Society of Civil
Engineers, in consequence of the liberality of Sir Joseph Banks, who
had purchased, and presented them to the Society for this purpose.
They fill three quarto volumes, and constitute a most interesting and
valuable series of treatises on every branch of engineering; as draining,
bridge-building, making and improving canals and navigable rivers,
planning docks and harbours, the improvement of mill-work, and the
application of mechanical improvements to different manufactures. His
papers in the Philosophical Transactions are published separately, and
fill another quarto volume. They contain descriptions of those early
inventions which we have mentioned, and of an improved air-pump,
and a new hygrometer and pyrometer; together with his treatise on
Mill-work, and some papers which show that he was fond of the science
of astronomy, and practically skilled in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>His health began to decline about 1785, and he endeavoured to
withdraw from business, and to devote his attention to publishing an
account of his own inventions and works; for as he often said, âhe
thought he could not render so much service to his country as by doing
that.â He succeeded in bringing out his elaborate account of the
Eddystone Light-house, published in 1791. But he found it impossible
to withdraw entirely from business: and it appears that over-exertion
and anxiety did actually bring on an attack of paralysis, to which his
family were constitutionally liable. He was taken ill at his residence at
Austhorpe, in September, 1792, and died October 28, in the sixty-ninth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>year of his age. He had long looked to this disease as the probable
termination of his life, and felt some anxiety concerning the likelihood
of out-living his faculties, and in his own words, of âlingering over
the dregs after the spirit had evaporated.â This calamity was spared
him: in the interval between his first attack and his death, his mind
was unclouded, and he continued to take his usual interest in the
occupations of his domestic circle. Sometimes only he would complain,
with a smile, of his slowness of apprehension, and say, âIt cannot
be otherwise: the shadow must lengthen as the sun goes down.â</p>

<p class='c000'>His character was marked by undeviating uprightness, industry, and
moderation in pursuit of riches. His gains might have been far larger;
but he relinquished more than one appointment which brought in a
considerable income, to devote his attention to other objects which
he had more at heart; and he declined the magnificent offers of
Catharine II. of Russia, who would have bought his services at any
price. His industry was unwearied, and the distribution of his hours
and employments strictly laid down by rule. In his family and by his
friends he was singularly beloved, though his demeanour sometimes
appeared harsh to strangers. A brief, but very interesting and affectionate
account of him, written by his daughter, is prefixed to his
Reports, from which many of the anecdotes here related have been
derived.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the many great undertakings in which Smeaton was engaged,
the most original, and the most celebrated, is the Eddystone light-house.
The reef of rocks known by the name of the Eddystone lies
about nine miles and a half from the Ram Head, at the entrance of
Plymouth Sound, exposed to the full swell of the Atlantic, which, with
a very moderate gale, breaks upon it with the utmost fury. The situation,
directly between the Lizard and Start points, makes it of the
utmost importance to have a light-house on it; and in 1698 Mr.
Winstanley succeeded in completing one. This stood till 1703, but
was entirely carried away in the memorable storm of November 26,
in that year. It chanced, by a singular coincidence, that shortly
before, on a doubt of the stability of the building being uttered, the
architect expressed himself so entirely satisfied on that point, that âhe
should only wish to be there in the greatest storm that ever blew under
the face of the heavens.â He was gratified in his wish; and perished
with every person in the building. This building was chiefly, if not
wholly of timber. In 1706 Mr. Rudyerd commenced a new light-house,
partly of stone and partly of wood, which stood till 1755, when
it was burnt down to the very rock. Warned by this accident, Smeaton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>resolved that his should be entirely of stone. He spent much time in
considering the best methods of grafting his work securely on the solid
rock, and giving it the form best suited to secure stability; and one of
the most interesting parts of his interesting account, is that in which
he narrates how he was led to choose the shape which he adopted,
by considering the means employed by nature to produce stability in
her works. The building is modelled on the trunk of an oak, which
spreads out in a sweeping curve near the roots, so as to give breadth
and strength to its base, diminishes as it rises, and again swells out as
it approaches to the bushy head, to give room for the strong insertion
of the principal boughs. The latter is represented by a curved cornice,
the effect of which is to throw off the heavy seas, which being suddenly
checked fly up, it is said, from fifty to a hundred feet above the very top
of the building, and thus to prevent their striking the lantern, even
when they seem entirely to enclose it. The efficacy of this construction
is such, that after a storm and spring tide of unequalled violence in
1762, in which the greatest fears were entertained at Plymouth for the
safety of the light-house, the only article requisite to repair it was a
pot of putty, to replace some that had been washed from the lantern.</p>

<p class='c000'>To prepare a fit base for the reception of the column, the shelving
rock was cut into six steps, which were filled up with masonry, firmly
dovetailed, and pinned with oaken trenails to the living stone, so that
the upper course presented a level circular surface. This part of the
work was attended with the greatest difficulty; the rock being accessible
only at low water, and in calm weather. The building is faced with
the Cornish granite, called in the country, moorstone; a material
selected on account of its durability and hardness, which bids defiance
to the depredations of marine animals, which have been known to do
serious injury by perforating Portland stone when placed under water.
The interior is built of Portland stone, which is more easily obtained in
large blocks, and is less expensive in the working. It is an instructive
lesson, not only to the young engineer, but to all persons, to see the diligence
which Smeaton used to ascertain what kind of stone was best fitted
for his purposes, and from what materials the firmest and most lasting
cement could be obtained. He well knew that in novel and great undertakings
no precaution can be deemed superfluous which may contribute
to success; and that it is wrong to trust implicitly to common methods,
even where experience has shown them to be sufficient in common cases.
For the height of twelve feet from the rock the building is solid. Every
course of masonry is composed of stones firmly jointed and dovetailed
into each other, and secured to the course below by <em>joggles</em>, or solid plugs
of stone, which being let into both, effectually resist the lateral pressure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>of the waves, which tends to push off the upper from the under course.
The interior, which is accessible by a moveable ladder, consists of four
rooms, one over the other, surmounted by a glass lantern, in which the
lights are placed. The height from the lowest point of the foundation
to the floor of the lantern is seventy feet; the height of the lantern is
twenty-one feet more. The building was commenced August 3, 1756,
and finished October 8, 1759; and having braved uninjured the storms
of seventy-three winters, is likely long to remain a monument almost
as elegant, and far more useful, than the most splendid column ever
raised to commemorate imperial victories. Its erection forms an era
in the history of light-houses, a subject of great importance to a maritime
nation. It came perfect from the mind of the artist; and has left
nothing to be added or improved. After such an example no accessible
rock can be considered impracticable: and in the more recent erection
of a light-house on the dangerous Bell-rock, lying off the coast of
Forfarshire, between the Frith of Tay and the Frith of Forth, which
is built exactly in the same manner, and almost on the same model,
we see the best proof of the value of an impulse, such as was given to
this subject by Smeaton.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>BUFFON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Buffon is reported to have saidâand the vanity which was his predominant
foible may have given some colour to the assertionââI know
but five great geniuses, Newton, Bacon, Leibnitz, Montesquieu, and
myself.â Probably no author ever received from his contemporaries
so many excitements to such an exhibition of presumption and self-consequence.
Lewis XV. conferred upon him a title of nobility; the
Empress of Russia was his correspondent; Prince Henry of Prussia
addressed him in the language of the most exaggerated compliment;
and his statue was set up during his life-time in the cabinet of Lewis
XVI., with such an inscription as is rarely bestowed even upon the
most illustrious of past ages<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. After the lapse of half a century we
may examine the personal character, and the literary merits, of this
celebrated man with a more sober judgment.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Majestati naturÃ¦ par ingenium.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The history of Buffon is singularly barren of incident. At an
early age he devoted himself to those studies of natural history which
have rendered his name so famous; and at eighty years old he was
still labouring at the completion of the great plan to which he had
dedicated his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>George Lewis le Clerc Buffon was born at Montbar, in Burgundy,
on the 7th September, 1707. His father, Benjamin le Clerc, was a
man of fortune, who could afford to bestow the most careful education
upon his children, and leave them unfettered in the choice of an occupation.
The young Buffon had formed an acquaintance at Dijon with
an Englishman of his own age, the Duke of Kingston. The tutor of
this nobleman was, fortunately, an accomplished student of the physical
sciences; and he gave a powerful impulse to the talents of Buffon,
by leading them forward in their natural direction. Without the
assistance of this judicious friend, the inclination of his mind towards
honourable and useful exertion might have been suppressed by the
temptations which too easily beset those who have an ample command
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of the goods of fortune. It was not so with Buffon. Although he
succeeded, at the age of twenty-one, to the estate of his mother, which
produced him an annual income of 12,000<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i>, he devoted himself with
unremitting assiduity to the acquisition of knowledge. Having travelled
in Italy, and resided some little time in England, he returned to
his own country, to dedicate himself to the constant labours of a man
of letters. His first productions were translations of two English
works of very different characterââHalesâ Vegetable Statics,â and
âNewtonâs Fluxions;â and, following up the pursuits for which he
exhibited his love in these translations, he carried on a series of experiments
on the strength of timber, and constructed a burning mirror,
in imitation of that of Archimedes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The devotion to science which Buffon had thus manifested marked
him out for an appointment which determined the course of his future
life. His friend, Du Fay, who was the Intendant of the â<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin du
Roi</span></i>â (now called the â<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin des Plantes</span></i>â), on his death-bed recommended
Buffon as the person best calculated to give a right direction
to this establishment for the cultivation of natural history. Buffon
seized upon the opportunities which this appointment afforded him of
prosecuting his favourite studies, with that energetic perseverance for
which he was remarkable. He saw that natural history had to be
written in a manner that might render it the most attractive species of
knowledge; and that philosophical views, and eloquent descriptions,
might supersede the dry nomenclatures, and the loose, contradictory,
and too-often fabulous narratives which resulted from the crude
labours of ill-informed compilers. To carry forward his favourite
object, it was necessary that the museum, over which he had now the
control, should be put in order and rendered more complete. He
obtained from the government considerable funds for the erection of
proper buildings; and the galleries of the â<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin des Plantes</span></i>,â which
now hold the fine collection of mammals and birds, were raised under
his superintendence. Possessing, therefore, the most complete means
which Europe afforded, he applied himself to the great task of describing
the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms of nature. A
large portion of this immense undertaking was left unperformed,
although, to use his own words, he laboured fifty years at his desk;
and much of what he accomplished was greatly diminished in value
by his determination to see natural objects only through the clouded
medium of his own theories. But, nevertheless, he has produced a
work which, with all its faults, is an extraordinary monument of genius
and industry, and which will long entitle him to the gratitude of mankind.
âWe read Buffon,â says Condorcet, âto be interested as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>as instructed. He will continue to excite a useful enthusiasm for the
natural sciences; and the world will long be indebted to him for the
pleasures with which a young mind for the first time looks into nature
and the consolations with which a soul weary of the storms of life
reposes upon the sight of the immensity of beings peaceably submitted
to necessary and eternal laws.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Buffon was in some particulars unqualified for the laborious duty he
had undertaken. He delighted to indulge in broad and general views,
and to permit his imagination to luxuriate in striking descriptions.
But he had neither the patience, nor the love of accuracy, which would
have carried him into those minute details which give to natural
history its highest value. He, however, had the merit and the good
fortune, in the early stages of his undertaking, to associate himself
with a fellow-labourer who possessed those qualities in which he was
deficient. The first fifteen volumes of â<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">LâHistoire Naturelle</span></cite>,â which
treat of the theory of the earth, the nature of animals, and the history of
man and viviparous quadrupeds, were published between 1749 and 1767,
as the joint work of Buffon and Daubenton. The general theories,
the descriptions of the phenomena of nature, and the pictures of the
habits of animals, were by Buffon. Daubenton confined himself to
the precise delineation of their physical character, both in their external
forms and their anatomy. But Daubenton refused to continue his
assistance in the âHistory of Birds;â for Buffon, unwilling that the
fame which he had acquired should be partaken by one whom he considered
only as a humble and subordinate labourer, allowed an edition
of the History of Quadrupeds to be published, of which the descriptive
and anatomical parts had been greatly abridged. In the History of
Birds, therefore, Buffon had to seek for other associates; and the form
of the work was greatly changed from that of the previous volumes.
The particular descriptions are here very meagre, and anatomical
details are almost entirely excluded. In some of the volumes, Buffon
was assisted by GuÃ©neau de Montbeillard, who, instead of endeavouring
to attain the accuracy of Daubenton, affected to imitate the style of his
employer. To the three last volumes of the Birds the AbbÃ© Bexon
lent his aid. The nine volumes of Birds appeared between 1770
and 1783. Buffon published alone his âHistory of Minerals,â which
appeared in five volumes, between 1783 and 1788. Seven volumes of
Supplements complete the Natural History. The first appeared in
1773; the last was not published till the year after its authorâs death,
in 1789. The fifth volume of these Supplements is a distinct work,
the Epochs of Nature<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The best edition of the works of Buffon is the first, of 36 vols. 4to.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The study of natural history, and the composition of his great
work, occupied the mind of Buffon from his first appointment as
Intendant of the â<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin du Roi</span></i>,â to within a few days of his death.
In the prosecution of the plan he had laid down, he never permitted
the slightest interruption. Pleasure and indolence had their attractions;âbut
they never held him for many hours from his favourite
pursuits. Buffon spent the greater part of his time at Montbar,
where, during some years, his friend Daubenton also resided. It
was here that Buffon composed nearly the whole of his works. Many
interesting details have been preserved of his habits of life, and
his mode of composition. He was, like all men who have accomplished
great literary undertakings, a severe economist of his time.
The employment of every day was fixed with the greatest exactness.
He used almost invariably to rise at five oâclock, compelling his
man-servant to drag him out of bed whenever he was unwilling
to get up. âI owe to poor Joseph,â he used to say, âten or twelve
volumes of my works.â At the end of his garden was a pavilion
which served him as a study. Here he was seated for many hours
of every day, in an old leathern chair, before a table of black birch,
with his papers arranged in a large walnut-tree escritoire. Before
he began to write he was accustomed to meditate for a long time
upon his subject. Composition was to him a real delight; and he
used to declare that he had spent twelve or fourteen hours successively
at his desk, continuing to the last in a state of pleasure. His
endeavours to obtain the utmost correctness of expression furnished a
remarkable proof of the persevering quality of his mind. He composed,
and copied, and read his works to friends, and re-copied, till he was
entirely satisfied. It is said that he made eleven transcripts of the
Epochs of Nature. In his domestic habits there was little to admire in
the character of Buffon. His conversation was trifling and licentious,
and the grossness which too often discloses itself in his writings was
ill-concealed in his own conduct. He paid the most minute attention
to dress, and delighted in walking to church to exhibit his finery to his
wondering neighbours. Although he was entirely devoid of religious
principle, and constantly endeavoured in his writings to throw discredit
upon the belief of a great First Cause, he regularly attended
high mass, received the communion, and distributed alms to pious
beggars. In his whole character there appears a total absence of that
simplicity which is the distinguishing attribute of men of the very
highest genius.</p>

<p class='c000'>The literary glory of Buffon, although surpassed, or even equalled,
during his life, by none of his contemporaries, with the exception perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>of Voltaire and Rousseau, has not increased, and is perhaps
materially diminished, after having been tried by the opinions of half a
century. In literature, as well as in politics, as we have learnt to attach
a greater value to accurate facts, have we become less captivated by the
force of eloquence alone. Buffon gave an extraordinary impulse to
the love of natural history, by surrounding its details with splendid
images, and escaping from its rigid investigations by bold and dazzling
theories. He rejected classification; and took no pains to distinguish
by precise names the objects which he described, because such accuracy
would have impeded the progress of his magnificent generalizations.
Without classification, and an accurate nomenclature, natural history
is a mere chaos. Buffon saw the productions of nature only in
masses. He made no endeavour to delineate with perfect accuracy
any individual of that immense body, nor to trace the relations of an
individual to all the various forms of being by which it is surrounded.
Although he was a profound admirer of Newton, and classed Bacon
amongst the most illustrious of men, he constantly deviated from
the principle of that philosophy upon which all modern discovery
has been founded. He carried onward his hypotheses with little
calculation and less experiment. And yet, although they are often
misapplied, he has collected an astonishing number of facts; and even
many of his boldest generalities have been based upon a sufficient
foundation of truth, to furnish important assistance to the investigations
of more accurate inquirers. The persevering obliquity with which he
turns away from the evidence of Design in the creation, to rest upon
some vague notions of a self-creative power, both in animate and
inanimate existence, is one of the most unpleasant features of his
writings. How much higher services might Buffon have rendered to
natural history had he been imbued not only with a spirit of accurate
and comprehensive classification, but with a perception of the constant
agency of a Creator, of both of which merits he had so admirable an
example in our own Ray.</p>

<p class='c000'>The style of Buffon, viewed as an elaborate work of art, and without
regard to the great object of style, that of conveying thoughts in the
clearest and simplest manner, is captivating from its sustained harmony
and occasional grandeur. But it is a style of a past age. Even in
his own day, it was a theme for ridicule with those who knew the real
force of conciseness and simplicity. Voltaire described it as â<em>empoulÃ©</em>;â
and when some one talked to him of â<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">LâHistoire Naturelle</span></cite>,â he drily
replied, â<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pas si naturelle</span></i>.â But Buffon was not carried away by the
mere love of fine writing. He knew his own power; and, looking
at the state of science in his day, he seized upon the instrument
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>which was best calculated to elevate him amongst his contemporaries.
The very exaggerations of his style were perhaps necessary to render
natural history at once attractive to all descriptions of people. Up to
his time it had been a dry and repulsive study. He first clothed it
with the picturesque and poetical; threw a moral sentiment around its
commonest details; exhibited animals in connection with man, in his
mightiest and most useful works; and described the great phenomena
of nature with a pomp of language which had never before been
called to the service of philosophical investigation. The publication of
his works carried the study of natural history out of the closets of the
few, to become a source of delight and instruction to all men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Buffon died at Paris on the 16th April, 1788, aged 81. He was
married, in 1762, to Mademoiselle de St. BÃ©lin; and he left an only
son, who succeeded to his title. This unfortunate young man perished
on the scaffold, in 1795, almost one of the last victims of the fury
of the revolution. When he ascended to the guillotine he exclaimed,
with great composure, âMy name is Buffon.â</p>

<p class='c000'>A succinct and clear memoir of Buffon, by Cuvier, in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Biographie
Universelle</span></cite>, may be advantageously consulted. Nearly all the details
of his private life are derived from a curious work by RÃ©nault de
SÃ©chelles, entitled <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyage Ã  Montbar</span></cite>, which, like many other domestic
histories of eminent men, has the disgrace of being founded upon a
violation of the laws of hospitality.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>MORE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This great man was born in London, in the year 1480. His father
was Sir John More, one of the Judges of the Kingâs Bench, a gentleman
of established reputation. He was early placed in the family of
Cardinal Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Lord Chancellor of
England. The sons of the gentry were at this time sent into the
families of the first nobility and leading statesmen, on an equivocal
footing; partly for the finishing of their education, and partly in a
menial capacity. The Cardinal said more than once to the nobility
who were dining with him, âThis boy waiting at table, whosoever
lives to see it, will one day prove a marvellous man.â His eminent
patron was highly delighted with that vivacity and wit which appeared
in his childhood, and did not desert him on the scaffold. Plays were performed
in the archiepiscopal household at Christmas. On these occasions
young More would play the improvisatore, and introduce an extempore
part of his own, more amusing to the spectators than all the rest
of the performance. In due time Morton sent him to Oxford, where
he heard the lectures of Linacer and Grocyn on the Greek and Latin
languages. The epigrams and translations printed in his works
evince his skill in both. After a regular course of rhetoric, logic, and
philosophy, at Oxford, he removed to London, where he became a law
student, first in New Inn, and afterwards in Lincolnâs Inn. He
gained considerable reputation by reading public lectures on Saint
Augustine, De Civitate Dei, at Saint Lawrenceâs church in the Old
Jewry. The most learned men in the city of London attended him;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>among the rest Grocyn, his lecturer in Greek at Oxford, and a writer
against the doctrines of Wickliff. The object of Moreâs prolusions
was not so much to discuss points in theology, as to explain the precepts
of moral philosophy, and clear up difficulties in history. For
more than three years after this he was Law-reader at Furnivalâs
Inn. He next removed to the Charter-House, where he lived in
devotion and prayer; and it is stated that from the age of twenty he
wore a hair-shirt next his skin. He remained there about four years,
without taking the vows, although he performed all the spiritual
exercises of the society, and had a strong inclination to enter the
priesthood. But his spiritual adviser, Dr. Colet, Dean of St. Paulâs,
recommended him to adopt a different course. On a visit to a gentleman
of Essex, by name Colt, he was introduced to his three daughters,
and became attached to the second, who was the handsomest of the
family. But he bethought him that it would be both a grief and a
scandal to the eldest to see her younger sister married before her.
He therefore reconsidered his passion, and from motives of pity
prevailed with himself to be in love with the elder, or at all events
to marry her. Erasmus says that she was young and uneducated,
for which her husband liked her the better, as being more capable of
conforming to his own model of a wife. He had her instructed in
literature, and especially in music.</p>

<p class='c000'>He continued his study of the law at Lincolnâs Inn, but resided in
Bucklersbury after his marriage. His first wife lived about seven
years. By her he had three daughters and one son; and we are informed
by his son-in-law, Roper, that he brought them up with the most
sedulous attention to their intellectual and moral improvement. It
was a quaint exhortation of his, that they should take virtue and
learning for their meat, and pleasure for their sauce.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the latter part of King Henry the Seventhâs time, and at a very
early age, More distinguished himself in parliament. The King had
demanded a subsidy for the marriage of his eldest daughter, who was
to be the Scottish Queen. The demand was not complied with. On
being told that his purpose had been frustrated by the opposition of
a beardless boy, Henry was greatly incensed, and determined on
revenge. He knew that the actual offender, not possessing anything,
could not lose anything; he therefore devised a groundless charge
against the father, and confined him to the Tower till he had extorted
a fine of Â£100 for his alleged offence. Fox, Bishop of Winchester, a
privy councillor, insidiously undertook to reinstate young More in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Kingâs favour: but the Bishopâs Chaplain warned him not to listen to
any such proposals; and gave a pithy reason for the advice, highly
illustrative of Foxâs real character. âTo serve the Kingâs purposes,
my lord and master will not hesitate to consent to his own fatherâs
death.â To avoid evil consequences, More determined to go abroad.
With this view, he made himself master of the French language,
and cultivated the liberal sciences, as astronomy, geometry, arithmetic,
and music; he also made himself thoroughly acquainted with history:
but in the mean time the Kingâs death rendered it safe to remain in
England, and he abandoned all thoughts of foreign travel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding his practice at the bar, and his lectures, which were
quoted by Lord Coke as undisputed authority, he found leisure for the
pursuits of philosophy and polite literature. In 1516 he wrote his
Utopia, the only one of his works which has commanded much of
public attention in after times. In general they were chiefly of a
polemic kind, in defence of a cause which even his abilities could not
make good. But in this extraordinary work he allowed his powerful
mind fair play, and considered both mankind and religion with the
freedom of a true philosopher. He represents Utopia as one of those
countries lately discovered in America, and the account of it is feigned
to be given by a Portuguese, who sailed in company with the first discoverer
of that part of the world. Under the character of this Portuguese
he delivers his own opinions. His History of Richard III. was
never finished, but it is inserted in Kennetâs Complete History of
England. Among his other eminent acquaintance, he was particularly
attached to Erasmus. They had long corresponded before they were
personally known to each other. Erasmus came to England for the
purpose of seeing his friend; and it was contrived that they should
meet at the Lord Mayorâs table before they were introduced to each
other. At dinner they engaged in argument. Erasmus felt the keenness
of his antagonistâs wit; and when hard pressed, exclaimed,
âYou are More, or nobody;â the reply was, âYou are Erasmus, or
the Devil.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Before More entered definitively into the service of Henry VIII.
his learning, wisdom, and experience were held in such high estimation,
that he was twice sent on important commercial embassies. His
discretion in those employments made the King desirous of securing
him for the service of the court; and he commissioned Wolsey, then
Lord Chancellor, to engage him. But so little inclined was he to
involve himself in political intrigues, that the Kingâs wish was not at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the time accomplished. Soon after, More was retained as counsel for
the Pope, for the purpose of reclaiming the forfeiture of a ship. His
argument was so learned, and his conduct in the cause so judicious
and upright, that the ship was restored. The King upon this insisted
on having him in his service; and, as the first step to preferment,
made him Master of the Requests, a Knight and Privy Councillor.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1520 he was made Treasurer of the Exchequer: he then bought
a house by the river-side at Chelsea, where he had settled with his
family. He had at that time buried his first wife and was married to a
second. He continued in the Kingâs service full twenty years, during
which time his royal master conferred with him on various subjects,
including astronomy, geometry, and divinity; and frequently consulted
him on his private concerns. Moreâs pleasant temper and witty
conversation made him such a favourite at the palace, as almost to
estrange him from his own family; and under these circumstances his
peculiar humour manifested itself; for he so restrained the natural
bias of his freedom and mirth as to render himself a less amusing
companion, and at length to be seldom sent for but on occasions of
business.</p>

<p class='c000'>A more important circumstance gave More much consequence with
the King. The latter was preparing his answer to Luther, and Sir
Thomas assisted him in the controversy. While this was going on,
the King one day came to dine with him; and after dinner walked
with him in the garden with his arm round his neck. After Henryâs
departure, Mr. Roper, Sir Thomasâs son-in-law, remarked on the
Kingâs familiarity, as exceeding even that used towards Cardinal
Wolsey, with whom he had only once been seen to walk arm in arm.
The answer of Sir Thomas was shrewd and almost prophetic. âI
find his Grace my very good lord indeed, and I believe he doth as
singularly favour me as any subject within this realm. However,
Son Roper, I may tell thee, I have no cause to be proud thereof;
for if my head would win him a castle in France it should not fail
to go.â</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1523 he was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons, and displayed
great intrepidity in the discharge of that office. Wolsey was
afraid lest this parliament should refuse a great subsidy about to be
demanded, and announced his intention of being present at the debate.
He had previously expressed his indignation at the publicity given to
the proceedings of the house, which he had compared to the gossip of
an ale-house. Sir Thomas More therefore persuaded the members to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>admit not only the Cardinal, but all his pomp; his maces, poll-axes,
crosses, hat, and great seal. The reason he assigned was, that should
the like fault be imputed to them hereafter, they might be able to shift
the blame on the shoulders of his Graceâs attendants. The proposal
of the subsidy was met with the negative of profound silence; and the
Speaker declared that âexcept every member could put into his one
head all their several wits, he alone in so weighty a matter was unmeet
to make his Grace answer.â After the parliament had broken up,
Wolsey expressed his displeasure against the Speaker in his own
gallery at Whitehall; but More, with his usual quiet humour, parried
the attack by a ready compliment to the taste and splendour of the
room in which they were conversing.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the death of Sir Richard Wingfield, the King promoted Sir
Thomas to the Chancellorship of the Duchy of Lancaster. At this
time the see of Rome became vacant, and Wolsey aspired to the
Papacy; but Charles V. disappointed him, and procured the election of
Cardinal Adrian. In revenge, Wolsey contrived to persuade Henry
that Catharine was not his lawful wife, and endeavoured to turn his
affections towards one of the French Kingâs sisters. The case was
referred to More, who was assisted by the most learned of the Privy
Council; and he managed, difficult as it must have been to do so, to
extricate both himself and his colleagues from the dilemma. His
conduct as ambassador at Cambray, where a treaty of peace was
negotiated between the Emperor, France, and England, so confirmed
the favour of his master towards him, that on the fall of the Cardinal
he was made Lord Chancellor. The great seal was delivered to him
on the 25th of October, 1530. This favour was the more extraordinary,
as he was the first layman on whom it was bestowed: but it
may reasonably be suspected that the private motive was to engage
him in the approval of the meditated divorce. This he probably suspected,
and entered on the office with a full knowledge of the danger
to which it exposed him. He performed the duties of his function for
nearly three years with exemplary diligence, great ability, and uncorrupted
integrity. His resignation took place on the 16th May, 1533.
His motive was supposed to be a regard to his own safety, as he was
sensible that a confirmation of the divorce would be officially required
from him, and he was too conscientious to comply with the mandate
of power, against his own moral and legal convictions.</p>

<p class='c000'>While Chancellor some of his injunctions were disapproved by the
common law judges. He therefore invited them to dine with him in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the council chamber, and proved to them by professional arguments
that their complaints were unfounded. He then proposed that they
should themselves mitigate the rigour of the law by their own conscientious
discretion; in which case, he would grant no more injunctions.
This they refused; and the consequence was, that he continued
that practice in equity which has come down to the present day.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was through the intervention of his friend the Duke of Norfolk
that he procured his discharge from the laborious, and under the circumstances
of the time, the dangerous eminence of the chancellorship,
which he quitted in honourable poverty. After the payment of his
debts he had not the value of one hundred pounds in gold and silver,
nor more than twenty marks a year in land. On this occasion his love
of a jest did not desert him. While Chancellor, as soon as the church
service was over, one of his train used to go to his ladyâs pew, and say,
âMadam, my Lord is gone!â On the first holiday after his train had
been dismissed, he performed that ceremony himself, and by saying at
the end of the service, âMadam, my Lord is gone,â gave his wife the
first intimation that he had surrendered the great seal.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had resolved never again to engage in public business; but the
divorce, and still more the subsequent marriage with Anne Boleyn,
which nothing could induce him to favour, with the Kingâs alienation
from the see of Rome, raised a storm over his head from which his
voluntary seclusion at Chelsea, in study and devotion, could not shelter
him. When tempting offers proved ineffectual to win him over to
sanction Anne Boleynâs coronation by his high legal authority, threats
and terrors were resorted to: his firmness was not to be shaken, but his
ruin was determined, and ultimately accomplished. In the next parliament
he, and his friend Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, were attainted of
treason and misprision of treason for listening to the ravings of Elizabeth
Barton, considered by the vulgar as the Holy Maid of Kent, and countenancing
her treasonable practices. His innocence was so clearly
established, that his name was erased from the bill; and it was supposed
to have been introduced into it only for the purpose of shaking his
resolution touching the divorce and marriage. But though he had
escaped this snare his firmness occasioned him to be devoted as a
victim. Anne Boleyn took pains to exasperate the King against
him, and when the Act of Supremacy was passed in 1534, the oath
required by it was tendered to him. The refusal to take it, which
his principles compelled him to give, was expressed in discreet and
qualified terms; he was nevertheless taken into the custody of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Abbot of Westminster, and upon a second refusal four days after was
committed prisoner to the Tower of London.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our limits will not allow us to detail many particulars of his life
while in confinement, marked as it was by firmness, resignation, and
cheerfulness, resulting from a conscience, however much mistaken, yet
void of intentional offence. His reputation and credit were very great
in the kingdom, and much was supposed to depend on his conduct at
this critical juncture. Archbishop Cranmer, therefore, urged every
argument that could be devised to persuade him to compliance, and
promises were profusely made to him from the King; but neither
argument nor promises could prevail. We will give the last of these
attempts to shake his determination, in the words of his son-in-law,
Mr. Roper:â</p>

<p class='c000'>âMr. Rich, pretending friendly talk with him, among other things
of a set course, said this unto him: âForasmuch as is well known,
Master More, that you are a man both wise and well learned, as well in
the laws of the realm as otherwise, I pray you, therefore, sir, let me be
so bold as of good-will to put unto you this case. Admit there were,
sir, an act of parliament that the realm should take me for King; would
not you, Mr. More, take me for King?â âYes, sir,â quoth Sir Thomas
More, âthat would I.â âI put the case further,â quoth Mr. Rich, âthat
there were an act of parliament that all the realm should take me for
Pope; would not you then, Master More, take me for Pope?â âFor
answer, sir,â quoth Sir Thomas More, âto your first case the parliament
may well, Master Rich, meddle with the state of temporal princes; but
to make answer to your other case, I will put you this case. Suppose
the parliament would make a law that God should not be God; would
you then, Master Rich, say that God were not God?â âNo, sir,â quoth
he, âthat would I not; sith no parliament may make any such law.â
âNo more,â quoth Sir Thomas More, âcould the parliament make the
King supreme head of the Church.â Upon whose only report was Sir
Thomas indicted of high treason on the statute to deny the King to be
supreme head of the Church, into which indictment were put these
heinous words, <em>maliciously</em>, <em>traitorously</em>, and <em>diabolically</em>.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Thomas More in his defence alleged many arguments to the discredit
of Richâs evidence, and in proof of the clearness of his own conscience;
but all this was of no avail, and the jury found him guilty.
When asked in the usual manner why judgment should not be passed
against him, he argued against the indictment as grounded on an Act
of Parliament repugnant to the laws of God and the Church, the government
of which belonged to the see of Rome, and could not lawfully be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>assumed by any temporal prince. The Lord Chancellor, however, and
the other Commissioners gave judgment against him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He remained in the Tower a week after his sentence, and during that
time he was uniformly firm and composed, and even his peculiar vein of
cheerfulness remained unimpaired. It accompanied him even to the
scaffold, on going up to which, he said to the Lieutenant of the Tower,
âI pray you, Master Lieutenant, see me safe up, and for my coming
down let me shift for myself.â After his prayers were ended he turned
to the executioner and said, with a cheerful countenance, âPluck up thy
spirits, man, and be not afraid to do thine office. My neck is very short,
take heed, therefore, thou strike not awry for thine own creditâs sake.â
Then laying his head upon the block, he bid the executioner stay till he
had removed his beard, saying, âMy beard has never committed any
treason;â and immediately the fatal blow was given. These witticisms
have so repeatedly run the gauntlet through all the jest-books that it
would hardly have been worth while to repeat them here, were it not for
the purpose of introducing the comment of Mr. Addison on Sir Thomasâs
behaviour on this solemn occasion. âWhat was only philosophy in this
extraordinary man would be frenzy in one who does not resemble him
as well in the cheerfulness of his temper as in the sanctity of his
manners.â</p>

<p class='c000'>He was executed on St. Thomasâs eve in the year 1555. The barbarous
part of the sentence, so disgraceful to the Statute-book, was
remitted. Lest serious-minded persons should suppose that his conduct
on the scaffold was mere levity, it should be added that he addressed the
people, desiring them to pray for him, and to bear witness that he was
going to suffer death in and for the faith of the holy Catholic Church.
The Emperor Charles V. said, on hearing of his execution, âHad
we been master of such a servant, we would rather have lost the best
city of our dominions than such a worthy councillor.â</p>

<p class='c000'>No one was more capable of appreciating the character of Sir Thomas
More than Erasmus, who represents him as more pure and white than
the whitest snow, with such wit as England never had before, and was
never likely to have again. He also says, that in theological discussions
the most eminent divines were not unfrequently worsted by him; but
he adds a wish that he had never meddled with the subject. Sir
Thomas More was peculiarly happy in extempore speaking, the result
of a well-stored and ready memory, suggesting without delay whatever
the occasion required. Thuanus also mentions him with much respect,
as a man of strict integrity and profound learning.</p>

<p class='c000'>His life has been written by his son-in-law, Roper, and is the principal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>source whence this narrative is taken. Erasmus has also been
consulted, through whose epistolary works there is much information
about his friend. There is also a life of him by Ferdinando
Warner, LL.D., with a translation of his Utopia, in an octavo volume,
published in 1758.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LAPLACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Pierre Simon Laplace was born at Beaumont en Auge, a small
town of Normandy, not far from Honfleur, in March, 1749. His
father was a small farmer of sufficient substance to give him the
benefit of a learned education, for we are told<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> that the future philosopher
gained his first distinctions in theology. It does not appear
by what means his attention was turned to mathematical science,
but he must have commenced that study when very young, as, on
visiting Paris at the age of about eighteen, he attracted the notice
of DâAlembert by his knowledge of the subject. He had previously
taught mathematics in his native place; and, on visiting the metropolis,
was furnished with letters of recommendation to several of the
most distinguished men of the day. Finding, however, that DâAlembert
took no notice of him on this account, he wrote that geometer a
letter on the first principles of mechanics, which produced an immediate
effect. DâAlembert sent for him the same day, and said, âYou
see, sir, how little I care for introductions, but you have no need of any.
You have a better way of making yourself known, and you have a
right to my assistance.â Through the recommendation of DâAlembert,
Laplace was in a few days named Professor of Mathematics in the
Military School of Paris. From this moment he applied himself to the
one great object of his life. It was not till the year 1799 that he was
called to assume a public character. Bonaparte, then First Consul,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>who was himself a tolerable mathematician, and always cultivated the
friendship of men of science, made him Minister of the Interior; but
very soon found his mistake in supposing that talents for philosophical
investigation were necessarily accompanied by those of a statesman.
He is reported to have expressed himself of Laplace in the following
way:ââ<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">GÃ©ometre du premier rang, il ne tarda pas a se montrer
administrateur plus que mÃ©diocre. DÃ©s son premier travail, les consuls
sâaperÃ§urent quâils sâÃ©toient trompÃ©s. Laplace ne saisissait aucune
question sous son vrai point de vue. Il cherchait des subtilitÃ©s
partout, nâavait que des idÃ©es problÃ©matiques et portait aufin <em>lâesprit
des infiniments petits</em> dans lâadministration.</span>â Bonaparte removed
him accordingly to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">SÃ©nat Conservateur</span></i>, of which he was successively
Vice-President and Chancellor. The latter office he received
in 1813, about which time he was created Count. In 1814 he voted
for the deposition of Napoleon, for which he has been charged with
ingratitude and meanness. This is yet a party question; and the
present generation need not be hasty in forming a decision which
posterity may see reason to reverse. After the first restoration
Laplace received the title of Marquis, and did not appear at the
Court of Napoleon during the hundred days. He continued his
usual pursuits until the year 1827, when he was seized with the
disorder which terminated his life on the 5th of May, in the seventy-eighth
year of his age. His last words were, â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce que nous connoissons
est peu de chose; ce que nous ignorons est immense.</span>â He has
left a successor to his name and title, but none to his transcendent
powers of investigation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A scanty account in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Biographie des Contemporains</span></cite>, and the Eloge read to the
Institute by M. Fourier, form our only materials for the personal life of <span class='sc'>Laplace</span>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The name of Laplace is spread to the utmost limits of civilization,
as the successor, almost the equal, of Newton. No one, however, who
is acquainted with the discoveries of the two, will think there is so
much common ground for comparison as is generally supposed. Those
of Laplace are all essentially mathematical: whatever could be done
by analysis he was sure to achieve. The labours of Newton, on the
other hand, show a sagacity in conjecturing which would almost lead
us to think that he laid the mathematics on one side, and used some
faculty of perception denied to other men, to deduce these results
which he afterwards condescended to put into a geometrical form,
for the information of more common minds. In the Principia of
Newton, the mathematics are not the instruments of discovery
but of demonstration; and, though that work contains much which is
new in a mathematical point of view, its principal merit is of quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>another character. The mind of Laplace was cast in a different
mould; and this perhaps is fortunate for science, for while we may
safely assert that Laplace would never have been Newton had he been
placed in similar circumstances, there is also reason to doubt whether
a second Newton would have been better qualified to follow that
particular path which was so successfully traversed by Laplace. We
shall proceed to give such an idea of the labours of the latter as our
limits will allow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The solution of every mechanical problem, in which the acting
forces were known, as in the motions of the solar system, had been
reduced by DâAlembert and Lagrange to such a state that the difficulties
were only mathematical; that is, no farther advances could be
made, except in pure analysis. We cannot expect the general reader
to know what is meant by the words, <em>solution of a Differential
Equation</em>; but he may be made aware that there is a process so
called, which, if it could be successfully and exactly performed in all
cases, would give the key to every motion of the solar system, and
render the determination of its present, and the prediction of its future
state, a matter of mathematical certainty. Unfortunately, in the present
state of analysis, such precision is unattainable; and its place is
supplied by slow and tedious approximations. These were begun by
Newton, whose object being to establish the existence of universal
gravitation, he was content to show that all the phenomena which
might be expected to result, if that theory were true, did actually take
place in the solar system. But here, owing to the comparatively imperfect
state of mathematical analysis, he could do little more than indicate
the cause of some of the principal irregularities of that system. His
successors added considerably to the number of phenomena which were
capable of explanation, and thereby increased the probability of the
hypothesis. Lagrange, the great rival of Laplace, if we consider his discoveries,
and his superior in the originality of his views, and the beauty
of his analysis, added greatly to the fund; but it was reserved for the
latter to complete the system, and, extending his views beyond the point
to which Newton directed his attention, to show that there is no marked
phenomenon yet observed by astronomers, regarding the relative motions
of the planets or their satellites, but what must necessarily follow, if
the law of gravitation be true. We shall select a few instances of the
success of his analysis. The average motions of Jupiter and Saturn
had been observed to vary; that of the former being accelerated, and
of the latter retarded. This fact, which Euler had attempted in vain to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>explain, was linked by Laplace to the general law, and shown to follow
from it. A somewhat similar acceleration in the moonâs mean motion
was demonstrated, as we have observed more fully in the life of Halley,
to arise from a small alteration in the form of the earthâs orbit, caused
by the attraction of the planets. A remarkable law attending the
motions of the satellites of Jupiter, viz.âthat the mean motion of the
first satellite, together with double that of the second, is always very
nearly equal to three times that of the thirdâwas so far connected
with the general law, that if, in the original formation of the system,
that relation had been nearly kept, the mutual attractions, instead of
altering it, would tend to bring it nearer the truth. We can here do no
more than mention the analysis of the phenomena of the tides, one of the
most important and most brilliant of Laplaceâs performances. Indeed
there is no branch of Physical Astronomy, we might almost say of
physics in general, which is not materially indebted to him. Superior
to Euler in the power of conquering analytical difficulties, he is almost
his equal in the universality of his labours.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great work of Laplace is the â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MÃ©canique CÃ©leste</span>,â a collection
of all that had been done by himself or others, concerning the theory
of the universe. It is far above the reach even of the mathematical
reader, unless he has given a degree of attention to the subject,
which few, at least in our day, will exert. But Laplace was an
elegant and clear-headed writer, as well as a profound analyst. He
has left, we will not say for the common reader, but for those who
possess the first elements of geometry, a compendium of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MÃ©canique
CÃ©leste</span>, in the â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">SystÃ¨me du Monde</span>.â This work is free from mathematical
details, and, were it his only production, would rank him high
among French writers. We recommend it as the best exposition of
the present state of our knowledge of the solar system.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if it be said that Laplace was much indebted to the labours of
Lagrange and others, for the methods which form the basis of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MÃ©canique CÃ©leste</span>, which is undoubtedly true, we have a splendid
instance of what might have been expected from him under any circumstances,
in the â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ThÃ©orie des ProbabilitÃ©s</span>.â The field was here open,
for though the leading principles of the science had been laid down,
and many difficult problems solved, yet some method was still wanting
by which sufficient approximation might be made to problems involving
high numbers. In the theory of chances the great complexity of the
operations required, soon renders the application of the clearest principles
practically impossible; or, we should rather say, would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>done so had it not been for the researches of Laplace. His work on
this subject is, in our opinion, even superior to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MÃ©canique CÃ©leste</span>,
as a proof of the genius of the author. The difficulties above described
disappear under an analysis more refined and artificial than any other
which has ever been used. The mathematician may or may not read
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MÃ©canique CÃ©leste</span>, according to whether he would wish or not to
turn his attention to physical astronomy; but the analyst must study
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ThÃ©orie des ProbabilitÃ©s</span>, before he can be said to know of what
his art is capable. The philosophical part of his work, with its
principal results, was collected by the author in the â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essai Philosophique
sur les ProbabilitÃ©s</span>,â in the same manner as those of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MÃ©canique CÃ©leste</span> were exhibited in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">SystÃ¨me du Monde</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mathematical style of Laplace is entirely destitute of the simplicity
of that of Euler, or the exquisite symmetry and attention to the
principles of notation, which distinguishes that of Lagrange. We
may almost imagine that we see the first rough form in which his
thoughts were committed to paper; and that, when by attention to a
particular case, he had hit upon a wider method, which embraced that
and others, he was content to leave the first nearly as it stood before
the generalization opened upon him. His writings abound with parts
in which the immediate train of investigation is dropped, either not to
be resumed at all, or at a much later period of the subject. He seems,
like the discoverer of a new channel, to have explored every inlet
which came in his way, and the chart of his labours consequently shows
the unfinished surveys on either side of the main track. This habit
is no fault, but quite the reverse, in a work intended for finished
mathematicians, to be the storehouse of all that could be useful in
future operations: but it makes both the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MÃ©canique CÃ©leste</span> and the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ThÃ©orie des ProbabilitÃ©s</span> present almost unconquerable difficulties to
the student. These are increased by the very wide steps left to be
filled up by the reader, which are numerous enough to justify us in
saying, that what is left out in these writings would constitute a mass
four times as great as that which is put in, and this exclusive of
numerical calculations. When we add that those two works are contained
in six quarto volumes, which hold more than two thousand five
hundred pages, some notion may be formed of the extent of Laplaceâs
labours.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be perceived that this slight sketch is intended only for those
who are not mathematicians. In conclusion, we may take the opportunity
of expressing a hope, that at no distant period analytical knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>will have become so general, and the public mind be so far
informed upon the great theory first propounded by Newton, and
reduced to demonstration by Lagrange and Laplace, that the evidence
furnished by the two last shall possess equal weight with the authority
of the first.</p>

<p class='c010'>George Frederic Handel, whom we will venture to call the
greatest of musicians, considering the state in which he found his art,
and the means at his command, was born at Halle, in the Duchy of
Magdeburg, February 24, 1684. He was intended, almost from his
cradle, for the profession of the civil law; but, at the early age of
seven, he manifested so uncontrollable an inclination, and so decided a
talent for the study of music, that his father, an eminent physician,
wisely consented to change his destination, and suffered him to continue
under the direction of a master those studies, which he had been secretly
pursuing with no other guide than his own genius.</p>

<p class='c000'>Friedrich Zachau, organist of the cathedral church of Halle, was the
first and indeed the chief instructor of Handel. He discharged the duties
of his office so well, that his pupil, when not nine years old, had become
competent to officiate for his teacher, and had composed, it is said,
many motets for the service of the church. A set of sonatas, written
by him when only ten years old, was in the possession of George III.,
and probably forms part of the musical library of our present sovereign.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1703 Handel went to Hamburg, where the opera was then
flourishing under the direction of Reinhard Keiser, a master of deserved
celebrity, but whose gaiety and expensive habits often compelled
him to absent himself from the theatre. On one of these occasions
Handel was appointed to fill his place as conductor. This preference
of a junior roused the jealousy of a fellow-performer, named Mattheson,
to such a degree that a rencontre took place between the rivals in the
street: and Handel was saved from a sword-thrust, which probably
would have taken fatal effect, only by the interposition of a music-score,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>which he carried buttoned up under his coat. Till this time
he had occupied but a very subordinate situation in the orchestra, that
of second <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ripieno</span></i> violin; for from the period of his fatherâs death he
had depended wholly on his own exertions, nobly determining not to
diminish his motherâs rather straitened income by any demands on her
for pecuniary assistance. But now an opportunity for making known
his powers was arrived; for the continued absence of the conductor
Keiser from his post induced the manager to employ Handel in setting
to music a drama called Almeria. So great was the success of this
piece, that it was performed thirty nights without interruption. The
year following he composed Florinda; and soon after, Nerone, both
of which were received in as favourable a manner as his first dramatic
effort; but not one of these is to be found in the collection formed by
George III., and they seem quite unknown to all writers on music,
except by their titles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The success of his operas at Hamburg produced a sum which
enabled him to visit Italy. Florence was the first city in which he
made any stay. He was there received in the kindest manner by the
Grand Duke Giovanni Gaston de Medicis, and produced the opera of
Rodrigo in 1709, for which he was presented with a hundred sequins,
and a service of plate. Thence he proceeded to Venice, where he
brought out Agrippina, which was received with acclamation, and
performed twenty-seven nights successively. It seems that horns and
other wind-instruments were in this opera first used in Italy as accompaniments
to the voice. Here the charms of his music made an
impression on the famous beauty and singer, Signora Vittoria, a lady
particularly distinguished by the Grand Duke; but in this, as in every
instance of a similar kind, Handel showed no disposition to avail
himself of any partialities exhibited in his favour. His thoughts were
nearly all absorbed by his art, and it is but just to conclude that he
was also influenced by those sentiments of moral propriety which so
distinctly marked his conduct through life. It is to be admitted,
however, that he was too much inclined to indulge in the pleasures of
the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>On visiting Rome he was hospitably and kindly entertained by
the Cardinal Ottoboni, a person of the most refined taste and princely
magnificence. Besides his splendid collection of pictures and statues,
he possessed a library of music of great extent, and kept in his
service an excellent band of performers, which was under the direction
of the celebrated Corelli. At one of the parties made by the
Cardinal, Handel produced the overture to Il Trionfo del Tempo, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>was attempted by the band so unsuccessfully, that the composer, in
his hasty manner, snatched the violin from Corelli, and played the
most difficult passages with his own hand. The Italian, who was all
modesty and meekness, ingenuously confessed that he did not understand
the kind of music; and, when Handel still appeared impatient,
only said, â<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ma, caro Sassone, questa musica Ã¨ nel stilo Francese, di
châio non mâintendo</span>ââ(âBut, my dear Saxon, this music is in the
French style, which I do not understandâ). And so far Corelli was
perfectly right; Handelâs overtures are formed after the model of
Lully, though, it is hardly necessary to add, he improved what he
imitated. This anecdote indicates the vast superiority in point of
execution possessed by the moderns. A learner of two yearsâ standing
would now play the violin part of any of Handelâs overtures at first
sight, without a fault.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Rome Handel composed his Trionfo del Tempo, the words of
which were written for him by the Cardinal Pamphilii, and a kind of
<em>mystery</em>, or <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">oratorio</span>, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Resurrezione</span>. The former he afterwards
brought out in London, with English words by Dr. Morell, under the
title of the Triumph of Time and Truth. From Rome he went to
Naples, where he was treated with every mark of distinction. But he
now resolved, notwithstanding the many attempts made to keep him
in Italy, to return to Germany; and in 1710 reached Hanover, where
he found a generous patron in the Elector, who subsequently ascended
the English throne as George I. Here he met the learned composer,
Steffani, who, having arrived at a time of life when retirement becomes
desirable, resigned his office of Maestro di Capella to the Elector, and
Handel was appointed his successor, with a salary of 1500 crowns,
upon condition that he would return to the court of Hanover at the
termination of his travels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards the end of 1710 Handel arrived in London. He was soon
introduced at court, and honoured with marks of Queen Anneâs favour.
Aaron Hill was then manager of the Italian opera, and immediately
sketched a drama from Tassoâs Jerusalem, which Rossi worked into
an opera under the name of Rinaldo, and Handel set to music. This
was brought out in March, 1711; and it is stated in the preface that it
was composed in a fortnight, a strong recommendation of a work to
those who delight in the wonderful rather than in the excellent: but in
fact there is nothing in this which could have put the composer to much
expense either of time or thought. Handel undoubtedly wrote better
operas than any of his contemporaries or predecessors; but he was
controlled by the habits and taste of the day, and knew by experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>that two or three good pieces were as much as the fashionable frequenters
of the Italian theatre would listen to, in his time.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the close of 1711 he returned to Hanover, but revisited London
late in 1712; and shortly after was selected, not without many
murmurs from English musicians, to compose a Te Deum and Jubilate
on occasion of the peace of Utrecht. The Queen settled on him a
pension of two hundred pounds as the reward of his labour,âand as
he was solicited to write again for the Italian stage, he never thought
of returning to his engagement at Hanover, till the accession of the
Elector to the British throne reminded him of his neglect of his royal
employer and patron. On the arrival of George I. in London, Handel
wanted the courage to present himself at court; but his friend, Baron
Kilmansegge, had the address to get him restored to royal favour.
The pleasing <em>Water-Music</em>, performed during an excursion made up
the river by the King, was the means by which the German baron
brought about the reconciliation; and this was accompanied by an
addition of two hundred pounds to the pension granted by Queen
Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the year 1715 to 1720, Handel composed only three operas.
The three first years of this period he passed at the Earl of Burlingtonâs,
where he was constantly in the habit of meeting Pope, who, though
devoid of any taste for music, always spoke and wrote in a flattering
manner of the German composer. The other two years he devoted
to the Duke of Chandos, Popeâs Timon; and at Cannons, the Dukeâs
seat, he produced many of his anthems, which must be classed among
the finest of his works, together with the greater number of his hautbois
concertos, sonatas, lessons, and organ fugues.</p>

<p class='c000'>A project was now formed by several of the English nobility for
erecting the Italian theatre into an Academy of Music, and Handel
was chosen as manager, with a condition that he should supply a certain
number of operas. In pursuance of this, he went to Dresden to
engage singers, and brought back with him several of great celebrity,
Senesino among the number. His first opera under the new system
was Radamisto, the success of which was astonishing. But there
were at that time two Italian composers in London, Bononcini and
Attilio, who till then had been attached to the opera-house, and were
not without powerful supporters. These persons did not passively
notice the ascendancy of Handel, and the insignificance into which
they were in danger of falling; they persuaded several weak and
some factious people of noble rank to espouse their cause, and to
oppose the German intruder, as they called the new manager. Hence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>arose those feuds to which Swift has given immortality by his well-known
epigram; and hence may be traced Handelâs retirement from a
scene of cabal, persecution, and loss. The final result of this, however,
was fortunate, for it led to the production of his greatest works, his
oratorios, which not only amply compensated him for all the injury
which his fortune sustained in this contest, but raised him to a height
of fame which he could never have gained by his Italian operas.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two contending parties, wishing to appear reasonable, proposed
something like terms of accommodation: these were, that an opera in
three acts should be composed by the three rivals, one act by each, and
that he who best succeeded should for ever after take the precedence.
The drama chosen was Muzio Scevola, of which Bononcini set the
first act, Handel the second, and Attilio the third. Handelâs âwon
the cause,â and Bononciniâs was pronounced the next in merit. But,
strange to say, though each no doubt strained his ability to the utmost
in this struggle, not a single piece in the whole opera is known in the
present day, or is, perhaps, to be found, except in the libraries of
curious collectors.</p>

<p class='c000'>This victory left Handel master of the field for some years, and the
academy prospered. During this period he brought out about fifteen
of his best operas. But the genius of discord must always have a seat
in the temple of harmony, and a dispute between the German manager
and the Italian soprano, Senesino, renewed former quarrels, broke up
the academy, materially damaged the fortune of the great composer,
and was the cause of infinite vexation to him during much of his
future life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Arbuthnot, always a staunch friend of Handel, now became his
champion, and his ridicule had more weight with the sensible portion
of the public than the futile arguments, if they deserve the name,
advanced by the noble supporters of Senesino. But fashion and prejudice
were, as usual, too strong for reason: a rival opera-house was
opened in Lincolnâs Inn Fields, and after having composed several new
operas, comprising some of his best, and having sacrificed nearly the
whole of his property and injured his health, in a spirited attempt to
support the cause of the lyric stage against the presumption of singers,
and the folly of their abettors, Handel was at last compelled to terminate
his ineffectual labours, and stop his ruinous expenses, by
abandoning the contest and the Italian opera together.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sacred musical drama, or oratorio, was ultimately destined
to repair his all but ruined fortune, and to establish his fame
beyond the reach of cavil, and for ever. Esther, the words of which it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>is said were the joint production of Pope and Arbuthnot, was composed
for the Duke of Chandos in 1720. In 1732 it was performed
ten nights at the Haymarket, or Kingâs Theatre. Deborah was produced
in 1733, and in the same year Athalia was brought out at
Oxford. These three oratorios were performed at Covent Garden, in
the Lent of 1734. Acis and Galatea, and Alexanderâs Feast, were
brought out in 1735; Israel in Egypt, in 1738; LâAllegro ed il
Penseroso, in 1739. Saul was produced at the theatre in Lincolnâs Inn
Fields in 1740. But up to this period his oratorios failed to reimburse
him for the expenses incurred; and even the Messiah, that
sublime and matchless work, was, as Dr. Burney, Sir John Hawkins,
and Handelâs first biographer, Mr. Mainwaring, all agree in stating,
not only ill attended, but ill received, when first given to the public, in
the capital of the empire, in 1741.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such miscarriages, and a severe fit of illness, the supposed consequence
of them, determined him to try his oratorios in the sister kingdom,
where he hoped to be out of the reach of prejudice, envy, and
hostility. Dublin was at that time noted for the gaiety and splendour
of its court, and the opulence and spirit of its principal inhabitants.
Handel, therefore, judged wisely in appealing to such a people. Pope
in his Dunciad alludes to this part of his history, introducing a poor
phantom as representative of the Italian opera, who thus instructs
Dullness:â</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But soon, ah soon, rebellion will commence,</div>
      <div class='line'>If Music meanly borrows aid from sense:</div>
      <div class='line'>Strong in new arms, lo! giant Handel stands,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like bold Briareus, with a hundred hands:</div>
      <div class='line'>To stir, to rouse, to shake the soul he comes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Joveâs own thunders follow Marsâs drums.</div>
      <div class='line'>Arrest him, empress, or you sleep no more.â</div>
      <div class='line'>She heardâand drove him to thâ Hibernian shore.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>âOn his arrival in Dublin,â we are told by Dr. Burney, in his
Commemoration of Handel, âhe, with equal judgment and humanity,
began by performing the Messiah for the benefit of the city prison.
This act of generosity and benevolence met with universal approbation,
as well as his music, which was admirably performed.â He
remained in Ireland about nine months, where his finances began to
mend, an earnest, as it were, of the more favourable reception which
he experienced on returning to London in 1742. He then recommenced
his oratorios at Covent Garden; Sampson was the first performed.
And now fortune seemed to wait on all his undertakings;
and he took the tide at the flood. His last oratorio became most
popular, and the Messiah was now received with universal admiration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and applause. Dr. Burney remarks, âFrom that time to the present,
this great work has been heard in all parts of the kingdom with
increasing reverence and delight; it has fed the hungry, clothed the
naked, fostered the orphan,â and, he might have added, healed the
sick. Influenced by the most disinterested motives of humanity,
Handel resolved to perform his Messiah annually for the benefit of the
Foundling Hospital, and, under his own direction and that of his
successors, it added to the funds of that charity alone the sum of
Â£10,300. How much it has produced to other benevolent institutions,
it is impossible to calculate; the amount must be enormous.</p>

<p class='c000'>He continued his oratorios till almost the moment of his death, and
derived considerable pecuniary advantage from them, though a considerable
portion of the nobility persevered in their opposition to him.
George II., however, was his steady patron, and constantly attended
his performances, when they were abandoned by most of his court.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the close of life, Handel had the misfortune to lose his sight,
from an attack of gutta serena, in 1751. This evil for a time plunged
him into deep despondency; but when the event was no longer doubtful,
an earnest and sincere sense of religion enabled him to bear his
affliction with fortitude, and he not only continued to perform, but
even to compose. For this purpose, he employed as his amanuensis
Mr. John Christian Smith, a good musician, who furnished materials
for a life of his employer and friend, and succeeded him in the management
of the oratorios. âTo see him, however,â Dr. Burney feelingly
observes, âled to the organ after this calamity, at upwards of seventy
years of age, and then conducted towards the audience to make his
accustomed obeisance, was a sight so truly afflicting to persons of sensibility,
as greatly diminished their pleasure in hearing him perform.â</p>

<p class='c000'>His last appearance in public was on the 6th of April, 1759. He
died that day week, on Good-Friday, thus realizing a hope which
he expressed a very few days before his decease, when aware that
his last hours were approaching. He was buried in Westminster
Abbey; the Dean, Dr. Pearce, Bishop of Rochester, assisted by all
the officers of the choir, performed the ceremony. A fine monument,
executed by Roubiliac, is placed in Poetâs Corner, above the spot
where his mortal remains are deposited; but a still more honourable
tribute to his memory was paid in the year 1784, by the performances
which took place under the roof which covers his dust. A century
having then elapsed from the time of his birth, it was proposed that
a Commemoration of Handel should take place. The management
of it was intrusted to the directors of the ancient concert, and eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of the most distinguished members of the musical profession. The
King, George III., zealously patronised the undertaking, and nearly
all the upper classes of the kingdom seconded the royal views. A
vocal and instrumental band of 525 persons was collected from all
parts, for the purpose of performing in a manner never before even
imagined, the choicest works of the master. The great aisle in
Westminster Abbey was fitted up for the occasion, with boxes for
the Royal Family, the Directors, the Bench of Bishops, and the Dean
and Prebendaries of the Church; galleries were erected on each side,
and a grand orchestra was built over the great west door, extending
from within a few feet of the ground, to nearly half-way up the great
window. There were four morning performances in the church: the
tickets of admission were one guinea each; and the gross receipts
(including an evening concert at the Pantheon) amounted to Â£12,736.
The disbursements rather exceeded Â£6,000, and the profits were given
to the Society for Decayed Musicians and the Westminster Hospital;
Â£6,000 to the former, and Â£1,000 to the latter. Such was the success
of this great enterprise, that similar performances, increasing each
year in magnitude, took place annually till the period of the French
Revolution, when the state of public affairs did not encourage their
longer continuance.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a composer, Handel was great in all stylesâfrom the familiar
and airy to the grand and sublime. His instinctive taste for melody,
and the high value he set on it, are obvious in all his works; but he
felt no less strongly the charms of harmony, in fulness and richness
of which he far surpassed even the greatest musicians who preceded
him. And had he been able to employ the variety of instruments
now in use, some of which have been invented since his death, and to
command that orchestral talent, which probably has had some share
in stimulating the inventive faculty of modern composers, it is reasonable
to suppose that the field of his conceptions would have expanded
with the means at his command. Unrivalled in sublimity, he might
then have anticipated the variety and brilliance of later masters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Generally speaking, Handel set his words with deep feeling and
strong sense. Now and then he certainly betrayed a wish to imitate
by sounds what sounds are incapable of imitating; and occasionally
attempted to express the meaning of an isolated word, without due
reference to the context. And sometimes, though not often, his want of
a complete knowledge of our language led him into errors of accentuation.
But these defects, though great in little men, dwindle almost
to nothing in this âgiant of the art:â and every competent judge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>who contemplates the grandeur, beauty, science, variety, and number
of Handelâs productions, will feel for him that admiration which
Haydn, and still more Mozart, was proud to avow, and be ready to
exclaim in the words of Beethoven, âHandel is the unequalled master
of all masters! Go, turn to him, and learn, with such scanty means,
how to produce such effects!â</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>PASCAL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Blaise Pascal was born June 19, 1623, at Clermont, the capital of
Auvergne, where his father, Stephen Pascal, held a high legal office.
On the death of his wife in 1626, Stephen resigned his professional
engagements, that he might devote himself entirely to the education of
his family, which consisted only of Blaise, and of two daughters.
With this view he removed to Paris.</p>

<p class='c000'>The elder Pascal was a man of great moral worth, and of a highly
cultivated mind. He was known as an active member of a small
society of philosophers, to which the Academie Royale des Sciences,
established in 1666, owed its origin. Though himself an ardent
mathematician, he was in no haste to initiate his son in his own
favourite pursuits; but having a notion, not very uncommon, that the
cultivation of the exact sciences is unfriendly to a taste for general
literature, he began with the study of languages; and notwithstanding
many plain indications of the natural bent of his sonâs genius, he
forbad him to meddle, even in thought, with the mathematics. Nature
was too strong for parental authority. The boy having extracted from
his father some hints as to the subject matter of geometry, went to
work by himself, drawing circles and lines, or, as he called them in
his ignorance of the received nomenclature, rounds and bars, and
investigating and proving the properties of his various figures, till,
without help of a book or oral instruction of any kind, he had advanced
as far as the thirty-second proposition of the first book of
Euclid. He had perceived that the three angles of a triangle are
together equal to two right ones, and was searching for a satisfactory
proof, when his father surprised him in his forbidden speculations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The figures drawn on the walls of his bed-chamber told the tale, and
a few questions proved that his head had been employed as well as
his fingers. He was at this time twelve years old. All attempts at
restriction were now abandoned. A copy of Euclidâs Elements was
put into his hands by his father himself, and Blaise became a confirmed
geometrician. At sixteen he composed a treatise on the Conic
Sections, which had sufficient merit to induce Descartes obstinately to
attribute the authorship to the elder Pascal or Desargues.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was his progress in a study which was admitted only as the
amusement of his idle hours. His labours under his fatherâs direction
were given to the ancient classics.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some years after this, the elder Pascal had occasion to employ his
son in making calculations for him. To facilitate his labour, Blaise
Pascal, then in his nineteenth year, invented his famous arithmetical
machine, which is said to have fully answered its purpose. He sent
this machine with a letter to Christina, the celebrated Queen of Sweden.
The possibility of rendering such inventions generally useful has been
stoutly disputed since the days of Pascal. This question will soon
perhaps be set at rest, if it may not be considered as already answered,
by the scientific labours of an accomplished mathematician of our own
time and country.</p>

<p class='c000'>It should be remarked that Pascal, whilst he regarded geometry as
affording the highest exercise of the powers of the human mind, held
in very low estimation the importance of its practical results. Hence
his speculations were irregularly turned to various unconnected subjects,
as his curiosity might happen to be excited by them. The late creation
of a sound system of experimental philosophy by Galileo had roused
an irresistible spirit of inquiry, which was every day exhibiting new
marvels; but time was wanted to develope the valuable fruits of its
discoveries, which have since connected the most abstruse speculations
of the philosopher with the affairs of common life.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no doubt that his studious hours produced much that has
been lost to the world; but many proofs remain of his persevering activity
in the course which he had chosen. Amongst them may be mentioned
his Arithmetical Triangle, with the treatises arising out of it,
and his investigations of certain problems relating to the curve called
by mathematicians the Cycloid, to which he turned his mind, towards the
close of his life, to divert his thoughts in a season of severe suffering.
For the solution of these problems, according to the fashion of the
times, he publicly offered a prize, for which La LoubÃ¨re and our own
countryman Wallis contended. It was adjudged that neither had fulfilled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the proposed conditions; and Pascal published his own solutions,
which raised the admiration of the scientific world. The Arithmetical
Triangle owed its existence to questions proposed to him by a friend
respecting the calculation of probabilities in games of chance. Under
this name is denoted a peculiar arrangement of numbers in certain
proportions, from which the answers to various questions of chances,
the involution of binomials, and other algebraical problems, may be
readily obtained. This invention led him to inquire further into the
theory of chances; and he may be considered as one of the founders
of that branch of analysis, which has grown into such importance in
the hands of La Place.</p>

<p class='c000'>His fame as a man of science does not rest solely on his labours in
geometry. As an experimentalist he has earned no vulgar celebrity.
He was a young man when the interesting discoveries in pneumatics
were working a grand revolution in natural philosophy. The experiments
of Torricelli had proved, what his great master Galileo had
conjectured, the weight and pressure of the air, and had given a
rude shock to the old doctrine of the schools that âNature abhors
a vacuum;â but many still clung fondly to the old way, and when
pressed with the fact that fluids rise in an exhausted tube to a certain
height, and will rise no higher, though with a vacuum above them,
still asserted that the fluids rose because Nature abhors a vacuum,
but qualified their assertion with an admission that she had some
moderation in her abhorrence. Having satisfied himself by his own
experiments of the truth of Torricelliâs theory, Pascal with his usual
sagacity devised the means of satisfying all who were capable of being
convinced. He reasoned that if, according to the new theory, founded
on the experiments made with mercury, the weight and general
pressure of the air forced up the mercury in the tube, the height of
the mercury would be in proportion to the height of the column of
incumbent air; in other words, that the mercury would be lower at the
top of a mountain than at the bottom of it: on the other hand, that if
the old answer were the right one, no difference would appear from
the change of situation. Accordingly, he directed the experiment to
be made on the Puy de DÃ´me, a lofty mountain in Auvergne, and the
height of the barometer at the top and bottom of the mountain being
taken at the same moment, a difference of more than three inches
was observed. This set the question at rest for ever. The particular
notice which we have taken of this celebrated experiment, made in his
twenty-fifth year, may be justified by the importance attached to it by
no mean authority. Sir W. Herschell observes, in his Discourse on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>the Study of Natural Philosophy, page 230, that âit tended perhaps
more powerfully than any thing which had previously been done in
science to confirm in the minds of men that disposition to experimental
verification which had scarcely yet taken full and secure root.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever may be the value of the fruits of Pascalâs genius, it
should be remembered that they were all produced within the space
of a life which did not number forty years, and that he was so
miserably the victim of disease that from the time of boyhood he never
passed a day without pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>His health had probably been impaired by his earlier exertions;
but the intense mental labour expended on the arithmetical machine
appears to have completely undermined his constitution, and to have
laid the foundation of those acute bodily sufferings which cruelly
afflicted him during the remainder of his life. His friends, with the
hope of checking the evil, sought to withdraw him from his studies,
and tempted him into various modes of relaxation. But the remedy was
applied too late. The death of his father in 1651, and the retirement
of his unmarried sister from the world to join the devout recluses of Port
Royal-des-Champs, released him from all restraint. He sadly abused
this liberty, until the frightful aggravation of his complaints obliged
him to abandon altogether his scientific pursuits, and reluctantly to
follow the advice of his physicians, to mix more freely in general
society. He obtained some relief from medicine and change of habits;
but, in 1654, an accident both made his recovery hopeless, and
destroyed the relish which he had begun to feel for social life. He
was in his carriage on the Pont de Neuilly, at a part of the bridge
which was unprotected by a parapet, when two of the horses became
unruly, and plunged into the Seine. The traces broke, and Pascal was
thus saved from instant death. He considered that he had received a
providential warning of the uncertainty of life, and retired finally from
the world, to make more earnest preparation for eternity. This accident
gave the last shock to his already shattered nerves, and to a certain
extent disordered his imagination. The image of his late danger was
continually before him, and at times he fancied himself on the brink
of a precipice. The evil probably was increased by the rigid seclusion
to which from this time he condemned himself, and by the austerities
which he inflicted on his exhausted frame. His powerful intellect
survived the wreck of his constitution, and he gave ample proof to the
last that its vigour was unimpaired.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his religious opinions he agreed with the Jansenists, and, without
being formally enrolled in their society, was on terms of intimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>friendship with those pious and learned members of the sect, who had
established themselves in the wilds of Port Royal. His advocacy of
their cause at a critical time was so important to his fame and to
literature, that a few words may be allowed on the circumstances which
occasioned it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jansenists, though they earnestly deprecated the name of
heretics, and were most fiercely opposed to the Huguenots and other
Protestants, did in fact nearly approach in many points the reformed
churches, and departed widely from the fashionable standard of
orthodoxy in their own communion. They were in the first instance
brought into collision with their great enemies the Jesuits by the
opinions which they held on the subjects of grace and free-will. As
the controversy proceeded, the points of difference between the contending
parties became more marked and more numerous. The rigid
system of morals taught and observed by the Jansenists, and the
superior regard which they paid to personal holiness in comparison
with ceremonial worship, appeared in advantageous contrast with the
lax morality and formal religion of the Jesuits. Hence, though there
was much that was repulsive in their discipline, and latterly, not a
little that was exceptionable in their conduct, they could reckon in
their ranks many of the most enlightened as well as the most pious
Christians in France. It was natural that Pascal, who was early
impressed with the deepest reverence for religion, should be attracted
to a party which seemed at least to be in earnest, whilst others were
asleep; and it is more a matter of regret than of surprise, that latterly,
in his state of physical weakness and nervous excitement, he should
have been partially warped from his sobriety by intercourse with men,
whose Christian zeal was in too many instances disfigured by a
visionary and enthusiastic spirit. The Papal Court at first dealt with
them tenderly; for it was in truth no easy matter to condemn their
founder Jansenius, without condemning its own great doctor the
celebrated Augustin. But the vivacious doctors of the Sorbonne, on
the publication of a letter by the Jansenist Arnauld, took fire, and by
their eagerness kindled a flame that well nigh consumed their own
church.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst they were in deliberation on the misdoings of Arnauld,
Pascal put forth under the name of Louis de Montalte the first of that
series of letters to âa friend in the countryââ<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ã  un provincial par un de
ses amis</span>âwhich, when afterwards collected, received by an absurd misnomer,
the title of the Provincial Letters of Pascal. In these letters,
after having exhibited in a light irresistibly ludicrous, the disputes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the Sorbonne, he proceeds with the same weapon of ridicule, all
powerful in his hand, to hold forth to derision and contempt the
profligate casuistry of the Jesuits. For much of his matter he was
undoubtedly indebted to his Jansenist friends, and it is commonly said
that he was taught by them to reproach unfairly the whole body of
Jesuits, with the faults of some obscure writers of their order. These
writers, however, were at least well known to the Jesuits, their
writings had gone through numerous editions with approbation, and
had infused some portion of their spirit into more modern and popular
tracts. Moreover, the Society of Jesuits, constituted as it was, had
ready means of relieving itself from the discredit of such infamous
publications; yet amongst the many works, which by their help found
a place in the index of prohibited books, Pascal might have looked in
vain for the works of their own Escobar. However this may be, it is
universally acknowledged, that the credit of the Jesuits sunk under the
blow, that these letters are a splendid monument of the genius of
Pascal, and that as a literary work they have placed him in the very
first rank among the French classics.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seems that he had formed a design, even in the height of his
scientific ardour, of executing some great work for the benefit of
religion. This design took a more definite shape after his retirement,
and he communicated orally to his friends the sketch of a comprehensive
work on the Evidences of Christianity, which his early death,
together with his increasing bodily infirmities, prevented him from
completing. Nothing was left but unconnected fragments, containing
for the most part his thoughts on subjects apparently relating to his
great design, hastily written on small scraps of paper, without order
or arrangement of any kind. They were published in 1670, with
some omissions, by his friends of Port Royal, and were afterwards
given to the world entire, under the title of the Thoughts of Pascal.
Many of the thoughts are such as we should expect from a man who
with a mind distinguished for its originality, with an intimate knowledge
of scripture, and lively piety, had meditated much and earnestly
on the subject of religion. In a book so published, it is of course easy
enough to find matter for censure and minute criticism; but most
Christian writers have been content to bear testimony to its beauties
and to borrow largely from its rich and varied stores. Among the
editors of the Thoughts of Pascal are found Condorcet and Voltaire,
who enriched their editions with a commentary. With what sort of
spirit they entered on their work may be guessed from Voltaireâs well
known advice to his brother philosopher. âNever be weary, my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>friend, of repeating that the brain of Pascal was turned after his accident
on the Pont de Neuilly.â Condorcet was not the man to be
weary in such an employment; but here he had to deal with stubborn
facts. The brain of Pascal produced after the accident not only the
Thoughts, but also the Provincial Letters, and the various treatises on
the Cycloid, the last of which was written not long before his death.</p>

<p class='c000'>He died August 19th, 1662, aged thirty-nine years and two months.</p>

<p class='c000'>By those who knew him personally he is said to have been modest
and reserved in his manners, but withal, ready to enliven conversation
with that novelty of remark and variety of information which might
be expected from his well stored and original mind. That spirit of
raillery which should belong to the author of the Provincial Letters,
showed itself also occasionally in his talk, but always with a cautious
desire not to give needless pain or offence.</p>

<p class='c000'>He seemed to have constantly before his eyes the privations and
sufferings to which a large portion of the human race is exposed, and
to receive almost with trembling, those indulgences which were denied
to others. Thus, when curtailing his own comforts that he might
perform more largely the duties of charity, he seemed only to be disencumbering
himself of that which he could not safely retain.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a philosopher, it is the great glory of Pascal, that he is numbered
with that splendid phalanx, which in the seventeenth century, following
the path opened by Galileo, assisted to overthrow the tyranny of the
schools, and to break down the fences which for ages had obstructed
the progress of real knowledge; men who were indeed benefactors to
science, and who have also left behind them for general use an
encouraging proof that the most inveterate prejudices, the most obstinate
attachment to established errors, and hostility to improvement
may be overcome by resolute perseverance, and a bold reliance on the
final victory of truth. No one, however, will coldly measure the
honour due to this extraordinary man by his actual contributions to
the cause of science or literature. The genius of the child anticipated
manhood: his more matured intellect could only show promises of
surpassing glory when it escaped from the weak frame in which it was
lodged.</p>

the life and works of Pascal, which first appeared in the complete
edition of his works in 1779, and has since been published separately
at Paris; to the Biographie Universelle; and to the life of Pascal,
written by his sister, Madame Perier, which is prefixed to her edition
of his Thoughts.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Desiderius Erasmus was born at Rotterdam on the 28th of October,
1467. The irregular lives of his parents are related by him in a
letter to the secretary of Pope Julius II. It is sufficient to state here,
that this great genius and restorer of letters was not born in wedlock.
His unsophisticated name, as well as that of his father, was Gerard.
This word in the Dutch language means <em>amiable</em>. According to the
affectation of the period, he translated it into the Latin term, Desiderius,
and superadded the Greek synonyme of Erasmus. Late in
a life of vicissitude and turmoil, he found leisure from greater evils
to lament that he had been so neglectful of grammatical accuracy as
to call himself Erasmus, and not Erasmius.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a passage of the life written by himself, he says that âin his early
years he made but little progress in those unpleasant studies to which
he was not born;â and this gave his countrymen a notion that as a
boy he was slow of understanding. Hereon Bayle observes that those
unpleasant studies cannot mean learning in general, for which of all
men he was born; but that the expression might apply to music, as he
was a chorister in the cathedral church of Utrecht. He was afterwards
sent to one of the best schools in the Netherlands, where his talents at
once shone forth, and were duly appreciated. His master was so well
satisfied with his progress, and so thoroughly convinced of his great
abilities, as to have foretold what the event confirmed, that he would
prove the envy and wonder of all Germany.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the age of fourteen Erasmus was removed from the school at
Deventer in consequence of the plague, of which his mother died, and
his father did not long survive her. With a view to possess themselves
of his patrimony, his guardians sent him to three several convents in
succession. At length, unable longer to sustain the conflict, he
reluctantly entered among the regular canons at Stein, near Tergou, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>1486. Much condescension to his peculiar humour was shown in
dispensing with established laws and customary ceremonies; but he
was principally led to make his profession by the arts of his guardians
and the dilapidation of his fortune. He describes monasteries, and
his own in particular, as destitute of learning and sound religion.
âThey are places of impiety,â he says in his piece â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Contemptu
Mundi</span>,â âwhere every thing is done to which a depraved inclination
can lead, under the mask of religion; it is hardly possible for any
one to keep himself pure and unspotted.â Julius Scaliger and his
other enemies assert that he himself was deeply tainted by these
impurities; but both himself and his friends deny the charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>He escaped from the cloister in consequence of the accuracy with
which he could speak and write Latin. This rare accomplishment
introduced him to the Bishop of Cambray, with whom he lived till
1490. He then took pupils, among whom was the Lord Mountjoy,
with several other noble Englishmen. He says of himself, that âhe
lived rather than studiedâ at Paris, where he had no books, and often
wanted the common comforts of life. Bad lodgings and bad diet
permanently impaired his constitution, which had been a very strong
one. The plague drove him from the capital before he could profit
as he wished by the instructions of the university in theology.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some time after he left Paris, Erasmus came over to England, and
resided in Oxford, where he contracted friendship with all of any note
in literature. In a letter from London to a friend in Italy, he says,
âWhat is it, you will say, which captivates you so much in England?
It is that I have found a pleasant and salubrious air; I have met with
humanity, politeness, and learning; learning not trite and superficial,
but deep and accurate; true old Greek and Latin learning; and withal
so much of it, that but for mere curiosity, I have no occasion to visit
Italy. When Colet discourses, I seem to hear Plato himself. In
Grocyn, I admire an universal compass of learning. Linacreâs acuteness,
depth, and accuracy are not to be exceeded; nor did nature ever
form any thing more elegant, exquisite, and accomplished than More.â</p>

<p class='c000'>On leaving England, Erasmus had a fever at Orleans, which
recurred every Lent for five years together. He tells us that Saint
Genevieve interceded for his recovery; but not without the help of a
good physician. At this time he was applying diligently to the study
of Greek. He says, that if he could but get some money, he would
first buy Greek books, and then clothes. His mode of acquiring the
language was by making translations from Lucian, Plutarch, and other
authors. Many of these translations appear in his works, and answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>a double purpose; for while they familiarized him with the languages,
the sentiments and the philosophy of the originals, they also furnished
him with happy trains of thought and expression, when he dedicated
his editions of the Fathers, or his own treatises, to his patrons.</p>

<p class='c000'>We cannot follow him through his incessant journeys and change
of places during the first years of the sixteenth century. His fame
was spread over Europe, and his visits were solicited by popes,
crowned heads, prelates, and nobles; but much as the great coveted
his society, they suffered him to remain extremely poor. We learn
from his â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Enchiridion Militis Christiani</span>,â published in 1503, that he
had discovered many errors in the Roman church, long before Luther
appeared. His reception at Rome was most flattering: his company
was courted both by the learned and by persons of the first rank and
quality. After his visit to Italy, he returned to England, which he
preferred to all other countries. On his arrival he took up his abode
with his friend More, and within the space of a week wrote his
â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Encomium MoriÃ¦</span>,â the Praise of Folly, for their mutual amusement.
The general design is to show that there are fools in all stations; and
more particularly to expose the court of Rome, with no great forbearance
towards the Pope himself. Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, Chancellor
of the University, and Head of Queenâs College, invited him to
Cambridge, where he lived in the Lodge, was made Lady Margaretâs
Professor of Divinity, and afterwards Greek Professor. But notwithstanding
these academical honours and offices, he was still so poor as
to apply with importunity to Colet, Dean of St. Paulâs, for fifteen
angels as the price of a dedication. âErasmusâs Walkâ in the
grounds of Queenâs College still attests the honour conferred on the
university by the temporary residence of this great reviver of classical
learning.</p>

<p class='c000'>On his return to the Low Countries, he was nominated by Charles
of Austria to a vacant bishopric in Sicily; but the right of presentation
happened to belong to the Pope. Erasmus laughed heartily at the
prospect of this incongruous preferment; and said that as the Sicilians
were merry fellows, they might possibly have liked such a bishop.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1516 he printed his edition, the first put forth in Greek,
of the New Testament. We learn from his letters, that there was one
college in Cambridge which would not suffer this work to be brought
within its walls: but the public voice spoke a different language; for
it went through three editions in less than twelve years. From 1516
to 1526 he was employed in publishing the works of Saint Jerome.
Luther blamed him for his partiality to this father. He says, âI
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>prefer Augustine to Jerome, as much as Erasmus prefers Jerome to
Augustine.â As far as this was a controversy of taste and criticism,
the restorer of letters was likely to have the better of the argument
against the apostle of the Reformation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The times were now become tempestuous. Erasmus was of a
placid temper, and of a timid character. He endeavoured to reconcile
the conflicting parties in the church; but with that infelicity commonly
attendant on mediators, he drew on himself the anger of both.
Churchmen complained that his censures of the monks, of their
grimaces and superstitions, had paved the way for Luther. On the
other hand, Erasmus offended the Lutherans, by protesting against
identifying the cause of literature with that of the Reformation. He
took every opportunity of declaring his adherence to the see of
Rome. The monks, with whom he waged continual war, would
have been better pleased had he openly gone over to the enemy:
his caustic remarks would have galled them less proceeding from
a Lutheran than from a Catholic. But his motives for continuing
in the communion of the established church, are clearly indicated
in the following passage: âWherein could I have assisted Luther,
if I had declared myself for him and shared his danger? Instead
of one man, two would have perished. I cannot conceive what he
means by writing with such a spirit: one thing I know too well,
that he has brought great odium on the lovers of literature. He has
given many wholesome doctrines and good counsels: but I wish he
had not defeated the effect of them by his intolerable faults. But
even if he had written in the most unexceptionable manner, I had no
inclination to die for the sake of truth. Every man has not the
courage necessary to make a martyr: I am afraid that, if I were put
to the trial, I should imitate St. Peter.â</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1522 he published the works of Saint Hilary. About the same
time he published his Colloquies. In this work, among the strokes
of satire, he laughed at indulgences, auricular confession, and eating
fish on fast-days. The faculty of theology at Paris passed the following
censure on the book: âThe fasts and abstinences of the church
are slighted, the suffrages of the holy virgin and of the saints are
derided, virginity is set below matrimony, Christians are discouraged
from becoming monks, and grammatical is preferred to theological
erudition.â Pope Paul III. had little better to propose to the cardinals
and prelates commissioned to consider about the reform of the
church, than that young persons should not be permitted to read
Erasmusâs Colloquies. Colineus took a hint from this prohibition:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>he reprinted them in 1527, and sold off an impression of twenty-four
thousand.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1524 a rumour was spread abroad that Erasmus was going to
write against Luther, which produced the following characteristic
letter from the Great Reformer: âGrace and peace from the Lord
Jesus. I shall not complain of you for having behaved yourself as
a man alienated from us, for the sake of keeping fair with the Papists;
nor was I much offended that in your printed books, to gain their
favour or soften their fury, you censured us with too much acrimony.
We saw that the Lord had not conferred on you the discernment,
courage, and resolution to join with us in freely and openly opposing
these monsters; therefore we did not expect from you what greatly
surpasseth your strength and capacity. We have borne with your
weakness, and honoured that portion of the gift of God which is in
you.... I never wished that deserting your own province you should
come over to our camp. You might indeed have favoured us not a
little by your wit and eloquence: but as you have not the courage
requisite, it is safer for you to serve the Lord in your own way.
Only we feared that our adversaries should entice you to write against
us, in which case necessity would have constrained us to oppose you to
your face. I am concerned that the resentment of so many eminent
persons of your party has been excited against you: this must have
given you great uneasiness; for virtue like yours, mere human virtue,
cannot raise a man above being affected by such trials. Our cause is
in no peril, although even Erasmus should attack it with all his might:
so far are we from dreading the keenest strokes of his wit. On the
other hand, my dear Erasmus, if you duly reflect on your own weakness,
you will abstain from those sharp, spiteful figures of rhetoric,
and treat of subjects better suited to your powers.â Erasmusâs answer
is not found in the collection of his letters; but he must have been
touched to the quick.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1527 he published two dialogues: the first, on âThe pronunciation
of the Greek and Latin Languages;â full of learning and curious
research: the second, entitled âCiceronianus.â In this lively piece he
ridicules those Italian pedants who banished every word or phrase
unauthorized by Cicero. His satire, however, is not directed against
Ciceroâs style, but against the servility of mere imitation. In a subsequent
preface to a new edition of the Tusculan Questions, he almost
canonizes Cicero, both for his matter and expression. Julius Scaliger
had launched more than one philippic against him for his treatment
of the Ciceronians; but he considered this preface as a kind of penance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>for former blasphemies, and admitted it as an atonement to the shade
of the great Roman. Erasmus had at this time fixed his residence at
BÃ¢sle. He was advancing in years, and complained in his letters of
poverty and sickness. Pope Paul III., notwithstanding his Colloquies,
professed high regard for him, and his friends thought that
he was likely to obtain high preferment. Of this matter Erasmus
writes thus: âThe Pope had resolved to add some learned men to the
college of Cardinals, and I was named to be one. But to my promotion
it was objected, that my state of health would unfit me for
that function, and that my income was not sufficient.â</p>

<p class='c000'>In the summer of 1536 his state of exhaustion became alarming.
His last letter is dated June 20, and subscribed thus: â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erasmus Rot.
Ã¦gra manu</span>.â He died July 12, in the 59th year of his age, and was
buried in the cathedral of BÃ¢sle. His friend Beatus Rhenanus
describes his person and manners. He was low of stature, but not
remarkably short, well-shaped, of a fair complexion, grey eyes, a
cheerful countenance, a low voice, and an agreeable utterance. His
memory was tenacious. He was a pleasant companion, a constant
friend, generous and charitable. Erasmus had one peculiarity,
humorously noticed by himself; namely, that he could not endure
even the smell of fish. On this he observed, that though a good
Catholic in other respects, he had a most heterodox and Lutheran
stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>With many great and good qualities, Erasmus had obvious failings.
Bayle has censured his irritability when attacked by adversaries; his
editor, Le Clerc, condemns his lukewarmness and timidity in the business
of the Reformation. Jortin defends him with zeal, and extenuates
what he cannot defend. âErasmus was fighting for his honour and his
life; being accused of nothing less than heterodoxy, impiety, and blasphemy,
by men whose forehead was a rock, and whose tongue was a
razor. To be misrepresented as a pedant and a dunce is no great
matter; for time and truth put folly to flight: to be accused of heresy
by bigots, priests, politicians, and infidels, is a serious affair; as they
know too well who have had the misfortune to feel the effects of it.â
Dr. Jortin here speaks with bitter fellow-feeling for Erasmus, as he
himself had been similarly attacked by the high church party of his
day. He goes on to give his opinion, that even for his lukewarmness
in promoting the Reformation, much may be said, and with truth.
âErasmus was not entirely free from the prejudices of education. He
had some indistinct and confused notions about the authority of the
Catholic Church, which made it not lawful to depart from her, corrupted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>as he believed her to be. He was also much shocked by the
violent measures and personal quarrels of the Reformers. Though, as
Protestants, we are more obliged to Luther, Melancthon, and others,
than to him, yet we and all the nations in Europe are infinitely
indebted to Erasmus for spending a long and laborious life in opposing
ignorance and superstition, and in promoting literature and true
piety.â To us his character appears to be strongly illustrated by his
own declaration, âHad Luther written truly every thing that he
wrote, his seditious liberty would nevertheless have much displeased
me. I would rather even err in some matters, than contend for the
truth with the world in such a tumult.â A zealous advocate of peace
at all times, it is but just to believe that he sincerely dreaded the
contests sure to rise from open schism in the church. And it was no
unpardonable frailty, if this feeling were nourished by a temperament,
which confessedly was not desirous of the palm of martyrdom.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is impossible to give the contents of works occupying ten volumes
in folio. They have been printed under the inspection of the learned
Mr. Le Clerc. The biography of Erasmus is to be found at large
in Bayleâs Dictionary, and the copious lives of Knight and Jortin.</p>

<p class='c010'>On looking back to the commencement of the sixteenth century, by
far the most brilliant epoch of modern art, we cannot but marvel at
the splendour and variety of talent concentrated within the brief
space of half a century, or less. Michael Angelo, Raphael, Correggio,
Titian, all fellow-labourers, with many others inferior to these mighty
masters, yet whose works are prized by kings and nobles as their most
precious treasuresâby what strange prodigality of natural gifts, or
happy combination of circumstances was so rare an assemblage of
genius produced in so short a time? The most obvious explanation is
to be found in the princely patronage then afforded to the arts by
princes and churchmen. By this none profited more largely or more
justly than the great painter, whose life it is our task to relate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tiziano Vecelli was born of an honourable family at Capo del
Cadore, a small town on the confines of Friuli, in 1480. He soon
manifested the bent of his genius, and at the age of ten was consigned
to the care of an uncle residing in Venice, who placed him under the
tuition of Giovanni Bellini, then in the zenith of his fame. The style of
Bellini though forcible is dry and hard, and little credit has been given to
him for his pupilâs success. It is probable, however, that Titian imbibed
in his school those habits of accurate imitation, which enabled him afterwards
to unite boldness and truth, and to indulge in the most daring
execution, without degenerating into mannerism. The elements of his
future style he found first indicated by Lionardo da Vinci, and more
developed in the works of Giorgione, who adopted the principles of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Lionardo, but with increased power, amenity, and splendour. As
soon as Titian became acquainted with this masterâs paintings, he
gave his whole attention to the study of them; and with such success,
that the portrait of a noble Venetian named Barbarigo, which he
painted at the age of eighteen, was mistaken for the work of Giorgione.
From that time, during some years, these masters held an equal place
in public esteem; but in 1507 a circumstance occurred which turned
the balance in favour of Titian. They were engaged conjointly in the
decoration of a public building, called the Fondaco de Tedeschi.
Through some mistake that part of the work which Titian had
executed, was understood by a party of connoisseurs to have been
painted by Giorgione, whom they overwhelmed with congratulations
on his extraordinary improvement. It may be told to his credit, that
though he manifested some weakness in discontinuing his intercourse
with Titian, he never spoke of him without amply acknowledging his
merits.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anxious to gain improvement from every possible source, Titian is
said to have drawn the rudiments of his fine style of landscape painting
from some German artists who came to Venice about the time of this
rupture. He engaged them to reside in his house, and studied their
mode of practice until he had mastered their principles. His talents
were now exercised on several important works, and it is evident, from
the picture of the Angel and Tobias, that he had already acquired an
extraordinary breadth and grandeur of style. The Triumph of Faith,
a singular composition, manifesting great powers of invention, amid
much quaintness of character and costume, is known by a wood
engraving published in 1508. A fresco of the Judgment of Solomon,
for the Hall of Justice at Vicenza, was his next performance. After
this he executed several subjects in the church of St. Anthony, at
Padua, taken from the miracles attributed to that saint.</p>

<p class='c000'>These avocations had withdrawn him from Venice. On his return,
in the thirty-fourth year of his age, he was employed to finish a large
picture left imperfect by Bellini, or, according to some authorities, by
Giorgione, in the great Council Hall of Venice, representing the Emperor
Frederick Barbarossa on his knees before Pope Alexander III. at
the entrance of St. Markâs. The Senate were so well satisfied with his
performance, that they appointed him to the office called La Senseria;
the conditions of which were, that it should be held by the best painter
in the city, with a salary of three hundred scudi, he engaging to paint
the portrait of each Doge on his election, at the price of eight scudi.
These portraits were hung in one of the public apartments of St.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Mark. At the close of 1514 Titian was invited to Ferrara by the Duke
Alphonso. For him he executed several splendid works; among them,
portraits of the Duke, and of his wife, and that celebrated picture of
Bacchus and Ariadne, now in our own National Gallery.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first works executed by Titian after his return to Venice,
prove that he had already accomplished that union of grand design
with brilliant colouring, which was designated by Tintoret as the
highest perfection of painting. His immense picture of the Assumption,
formerly in the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa, and now in
the Academy of Venice, exhibits, in the opinion of some first-rate
judges, various excellences, such as have never been combined in any
single performance, but by Titian himself<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a>. The Virgin, whose
figure relieves dark on the irradiated back-ground, seems to ascend
amid a flood of glory. She is surrounded and sustained by angels of
ineffable beauty, and the disciples below are personifications of apostolic
grandeur. It will scarcely be credited that the Monks, for whom this
picture was painted, objected to it on account of its apparent reality;
but the voice of public admiration soon made them sensible of its
merits, and they refused a large sum offered for it by the Imperial
Ambassador. Such a report of this work was made to Leo X. by
Cardinal Bembo, that Titian received an invitation to Rome from
the Pontiff, with the offer of honourable appointments. A similar
proposal from Francis I. of France, whose portrait he painted in
1515, he had already declined; but he yielded to the temptation of
visiting Rome, being not less anxious to see the great works of contemporary
genius, than the wonders of ancient art. He did not,
however, carry his purpose into effect at this time, but remained at
Venice; and thus secured to her the possession of those noble works,
which, when they were produced, formed the brightest ornament of
her power, and even now, when her other glories are set, confer upon
her an imperishable distinction.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The writer has been informed by Canova that this was his own opinion, and that of Sir
Thomas Lawrence.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>To recompense in some degree his relinquishment of this invitation,
Titian was employed by the Senate to paint the Battle of Cadore,
fought between the Venetians and the Imperialists; a splendid production,
which perished when the Ducal Palace was burnt. About
this time was painted the fine altar-piece of the Pesari Family
returning thanks to the Virgin for a victory over the Turks. This
picture, as an example of simple grandeur, has been contrasted by
Reynolds with the artificial splendour of Rubens; and Fuseli alludes to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>it as constituting the due medium between dry apposition and
exuberant contrast. The sublime picture of S. Pietro Martire was
painted in 1523. Of this it is difficult to speak in adequate terms,
without the appearance of hyperbolical panegyric. The composition
is well known by engravings; but these convey only a faint notion
of the original, which unites the utmost magnificence of historical
design, with the finest style of landscape-painting. The gorgeous
hues of Titianâs colouring are attempered in this picture by an impressive
solemnity. The scene of violence and blood, though expressed
with energy, is free from contortion or extravagance; grandeur pervades
the whole, and even the figure of the flying friar has a character
of dignity rarely surpassed. Two pictures on the same subject, the
one by Domenichino, in the Academy of Bologna, the other by Giorgione,
in our National Gallery, if compared with that of Titian, convey
a forcible impression of the difference between first-rate genius and
the finest talents of a secondary order. The picture of Giorgione is,
however, most <em>Titianesque</em> in colouring.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1526 the celebrated satirist Aretine, and Sansovino the sculptor,
came to reside in Venice. With these distinguished men Titian
contracted an intimacy, which was the source of great pleasure to him,
and ceased only with their lives. When Charles V. visited Bologna in
1529, Titian was invited to that city, where he painted an equestrian
portrait of the Emperor. Charles, not only an admirer but a judge of
art, was astonished at a style of painting of which he had formed no
previous conception; he remunerated the artist splendidly, and expressed
his determination never to sit to any other master. On returning to
Bologna in 1532, he summoned Titian again to his court, and engaged
him in many important works, treating him on all occasions with
extraordinary respect and regard. It is affirmed, that in riding through
Bologna he kept upon the artistâs right hand, an act of courtesy which
excited such displeasure among the courtiers that they ventured upon
a remonstrance. The answer given by Charles is well known, and has
been since ascribed to other monarchs: âI have many nobles in my
empire, but only one Titian.â On leaving Bologna, Titian accompanied
Frederic Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, home to his own state; where,
besides painting portraits of the Duke and his brother the Cardinal,
he ornamented an apartment of the palace contiguous to the rooms
painted by Giulio Romano, with portraits of the twelve CÃ¦sars,
taking his authorities from medals and antique marbles.</p>

<p class='c000'>In passing through Parma, on the way to Mantua, he first saw
the works of Correggio, who had been engaged in painting the dome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>of the cathedral. So little was that great manâs genius appreciated,
and such was the ignorance of his employers, that they had actually
dismissed him as inadequate to the task he had undertaken; nor was
he allowed to resume it, until the lavish admiration bestowed on his
work by Titian, had taught them better how to estimate his talents.</p>

<p class='c000'>On returning to Venice, Titian found that a strong party had been
raised in favour of Pordenone. He expressed no slight indignation
at the attempt to exalt that painter to an equality with himself. Pordenone,
nevertheless, was an artist of considerable powers, although
certainly not qualified to compete with such an antagonist. The
number of pictures which Titian continued to execute, would far
exceed our limits to enumerate, and is so great as to excite astonishment;
more especially as there is little evidence in his works that he
was much assisted by inferior hands. In 1543, when Pope Paul III.
visited Bologna, Titian painted an admirable portrait of him, and
received an invitation to Rome. But he was unable to accept it, having
engagements with the Duke of Urbino, whose palace he accordingly
enriched with portraits of Charles V., Francis I., the Duke Guidobaldo,
the Popes Sixtus IV., Julius II., and Paul III., the Cardinal
of Lorraine, and Solyman, Emperor of the Turks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Truth, it appears, rather than embellishment, was sought for in the
portraits of those days. Titianâs portrait of Paul III. is executed with
uncompromising accuracy. The figure is diminutive and decrepit,
but the eyes have a look of penetrating sagacity. His Holiness
was greatly pleased with it; and, as a mark of his favour, made offer
to the artist of a valuable situation in a public department; which
Titian declined, upon finding that his emoluments were to be deducted
from the income of those who already held possession of it. He
obtained, however, the promise of a benefice for his son Pomponio.
Aretine thought his friend illiberally treated by Paul, and did not
scruple to publish his opinion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1545, when the Venetian Senate was compelled by the public
exigencies to lay a general tax on the city, Titian was the only person
exempted from the impost,âa noble homage to genius, which attests
at once the liberality and the wisdom of that government. In this
year, Titian having completed his engagements with the Duke of
Urbino, and being, through the Cardinal Farnese, again invited to
Rome, determined on a visit to that city; and he set out, accompanied
by his son Orazio, several pupils, and a considerable number of
domestics. He was received at Urbino by the Duke Guidobaldo II.,
and splendidly entertained for some days. On his departure, the Duke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>accompanied him from Urbino to Pesaro, and from thence sent forward
with him a suite of horses and servants, as far as the gates of
Rome. Here he was greeted with corresponding honours, and lodged
in the Belvedere Palace. Vasari was, at this time, in the employment
of Cardinal Farnese, and had the gratification of attending the great
artist about the city. Titian was now engaged to paint a whole length
portrait of Paul III., with the Cardinal Farnese and Duke Ottavio in
one group. This picture is at present in the Museo Borbonico; and
is a fine example of that highest style of portrait painting, which is
scarce less difficult, or less elevated as a branch of art, than historical
composition. An â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ecce homo</span>,â painted at the same time, does
not appear to have excited that admiration which his works usually
obtained. The taste of the Roman artists and connoisseurs had
been formed on the severe examples of Michael Angelo, Raphael,
Polidoro, and others; so that the style of Titian was tried by a new
and conventional standard, to which it was not fairly amenable. It
was insinuated that his chief excellence lay in portrait-painting.
Vasari relates that, in company with Michael Angelo, he made a visit
to Titian at the Belvedere, and found him employed on the celebrated
picture of Danae. Michael Angelo bestowed high commendations on
it; but, as they went away, remarked to Vasari on Titianâs inaccurate
style of design, observing, that if he had received his elementary
education in a better school, his works would have been inimitable.
Nothing, perhaps, has tended more than this anecdote to give currency
to a belief that Titian was an unskilful draughtsman; an opinion
which, if tried by the test of his best works, is utterly erroneous.
There is not perhaps extant on canvass a more exquisite representation
of female beauty, even in point of design, than this figure of
Danae; and, with due reverence to the high authority of Michael
Angelo, it may be doubted whether his notion of correct design was not
tinctured by the ideal grandeur of his own style; which, however magnificent
in itself, and appropriate to the scale of the Sistine chapel, is
by no means a just medium for the forms of actual nature, nor adapted
to the representation of beauty. Michael Angelo however frequently
returned to look at this Danae, and always with expressions of increased
admiration.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a residence of two years at Rome, Titian returned to Venice,
taking Florence in his route. The first work on which he engaged
after his return, was a picture of the Marquis del Vasto haranguing his
troops. He likewise began some altar-pieces, but finished little, being
summoned in 1550, by the Emperor Charles, to Vienna. The princes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>and ministers assembled at the Imperial Court were astonished at the
confidence with which Titian was honoured by the Emperor, who gave
him free access to his presence at all times, a privilege extended only to
his most intimate friends. The large sums which the Emperor frequently
sent him, were always accompanied with the courteous assurance that
they were meant to testify the monarchâs sense of his merits, not in payment
for his works, those being beyond all price. On one occasion, while
the Emperor was sitting for his portrait, Titian dropt a pencil; the monarch
picked it up, and presented it to him, saying, on Titianâs apologizing
in some confusion, âTitian is worthy to be served by CÃ¦sar.â
The same jealous feeling which had been evinced towards him at
Bologna, again manifested itself; but the artist, who amidst his loftier
studies had not neglected the cultivation of worldly knowledge, found
means to obviate envy, and to conciliate, by courtesy and presents, the
good will of the whole court. It was at this time that Charles, sated
with glory and feeling the advances of infirmity, began to meditate his
retreat from the world. This intention, it is said, he imparted to Titian,
with whom he delighted to confer concerning the arrangement of a
large picture, which he then commissioned the artist to paint, and which
he intended to be his companion in his retirement. The subject was an
apotheosis, in which Charles and his family were to be represented as
introduced by Religion into the presence of the Trinity. At Inspruck,
whither he accompanied the Emperor, Titian painted a superb picture,
in which Ferdinand, King of the Romans, and his Queen Anna Maria,
are represented with the attributes of Jupiter and Juno, and round
them are the seven princesses, their daughters. From each of these
illustrious ladies, Titian received a jewel each time they sat to him.
Here also he collected portraits for the apotheosis.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the Emperorâs departure for Flanders, Titian returned to Venice;
where, soon after his arrival, he offered to finish the works which
were wanting in the great hall of the council. This offer was
cordially accepted by the Senate; and he was empowered to select the
artists whom he thought best qualified to be his coadjutors. He
nominated Paul Veronese and Tintoret, nor did those great painters
feel themselves humiliated in working under his directions. In 1553
the Emperor Charles returned to Spain, and being at Barcelona, nominated
Titian a Count Palatine of the empire, with all the privileges,
authority, and powers attached to that dignity. He also created him
a Knight of the Golden Spur, and a noble of the empire, transmitting
the dignity to his legitimate children and descendants. Crowned with
these honours, and with faculties scarcely impaired, Titian had now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>reached his seventy-fifth year; and it would be difficult to select
a man the evening of whose life has been more fortunate and
happy. He still found in the practice of his art a source of undiminished
pleasure; his works were sought by princes with emulous
avidity; he was considered the chief ornament of the city in which he
dwelt. He was surrounded by friends distinguished by their worth
or talents; he had acquired wealth and honour sufficient to satisfy
his utmost ambition; and he was secure of immortal fame!</p>

<p class='c000'>But at this period, to most men one of secession from toil, Titian
engaged in new undertakings with as much alacrity as if life were
still beginning, and the race of fortune still to run. He enriched
Serravalle, Braganza, Milan, and Brescia, with splendid works,
besides painting a great number for the churches of Venice, for
different noblemen, and for his friends. Philip II. of Spain showed
no less anxiety to possess his works, than Charles, his father, had done:
and nowhere perhaps, not even in Venice, are so many of his pictures
to be found, as in the palaces of Madrid and the Escurial. When
Rubens was in Spain, he copied Titianâs picture of Eve tempting
Adam with the fatal fruit, nobly acknowledging that he had only
made a Flemish translation of an elegant Italian poem. It is said by
some of Titianâs biographers, that he himself made a visit to Spain;
but this has been clearly disproved. The most important works which
he executed for Philip II. are the pictures of the Martyrdom of St.
Lorenzo, and the Last Supper. In the first, three different effects of
light are admirably expressed; the fire which consumes the saint, the
flame of a tripod placed before a pagan deity, and the glory of a
descending angel. This picture is said to be equal to any of his earlier
productions. The Last Supper betrays signs of a feebler execution,
which is, however, atoned for by more than usual purity of design.
Titian in this work partially imitated Lionardo da Vinci, but in the
spirit of congenial feeling, not as a plagiarist. To this picture, which he
began at the age of eighty, he devoted the labour of nearly seven years.
For Mary of England, Philip II.âs consort, he painted four mythological
subjects, Prometheus, Tityus, Sisiphus, and Tantalus, the
figures as large as life, and conceived in the highest style of grandeur.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1570 died Sansovino the sculptor. Aretine had paid the debt
of nature some years before, an event which sensibly affected Titian;
and this second loss plunged him into such affliction, that his powers,
it is said, from that time perceptibly gave way. We learn, however,
from Ridolfi, that the Transfiguration on Mount Tabor, which he
saw when in good condition, was ably executed. Some visions from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the Apocalypse, in the monastery of St. John, painted about the same
time, exhibit vivid imagination and fine colouring.</p>

<p class='c000'>Henry III. of France, being in Venice in 1574, paid Titian a visit,
accompanied by a numerous train. The venerable artist, then in his
ninety-fifth year, received the monarch with dignified respect; his
fine person was scarcely touched by decrepitude, his manners were
still noble and prepossessing. In a long conversation with the King,
he adverted, with the complacency natural to an old man at the close
of so splendid a career, to honours which he had received from the
Emperor Charles and King Ferdinand. When Henry, in walking
through the galleries, demanded the prices of some of the pictures,
he begged his Majestyâs acceptance of them as a free gift. In the
mean time the courtiers and attendants were entertained with a
magnificence, which might have become the establishment of a great
prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>Titian had nearly attained his hundredth year, when the plague,
which had been raging some time in Trent, made its appearance in
Venice, and swept him off, together with a third part of the inhabitants,
within three months. He was buried in the church of the
Frari; but the consternation and disorders prevalent at such a period,
prevented his receiving those funeral honours which would otherwise
have attended him to the tomb.</p>

<p class='c000'>In comparing Titian with the great artists of the Roman and
Florentine schools, it has been usual to describe him as the painter
of physical nature, while to those masters has been assigned the
loftier and exclusive praise of depicting the mind and passions. The
works on which Titian was most frequently employed, appertaining
to public edifices and the pomp of courts, were certainly of a class
in which splendid effect is the chief requisite; but can it be said that
the painter of the Ascension of the Virgin, and the S. Pietro Martire,
was unequal to cope with subjects of sublimity and pathos? May
it not be asked with greater justice, on the evidence of those pictures,
whether any artist has surpassed him in those qualities? Even
in design, on which point his capacity has been especially arraigned,
Titian knew how to seize the line of grandeur without swelling into
exaggeration, and to unite truth with ideality. Of all painters he was
most above the ostentation of art; like Nature herself, he worked
with such consummate skill that we are sensible of the process
only by its effect. Rubens, Tintoret, Paul Veronese, were proud of
their execution; few painters are not,âbut the track of Titianâs pencil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>is scarcely ever discernable. His chiaroscuro, or disposition of light
and shade, is never artificially concentrated; it is natural, as that of
a summerâs day. His colouring, glorious as it is, made up of vivid
contrasts, and combining the last degree of richness and depth with
freshness and vivacity, is yet so graduated to the modesty of nature,
that a thought of the painterâs palette never disturbs the illusion.
Were it required to point out, amidst the whole range of painting,
one performance as a proof of what art is capable of accomplishing,
it is surely from among the works of Titian that such an example
would be selected.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is scarcely any large collection in which the works of Titian
are not to be found. The pictures of ActÃ¦on and Callisto in the
possession of Lord F. L. Gower, and the four subjects in the
National Gallery, are among the finest in this country. The Venus
in the Dulwich Gallery must have been fine; but the glazing, a very
essential part of Titianâs process, has flown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Details of the life of Titian will be found in Vasari, Lanzi, Ridolfi,
but more especially in Ticozzi, whose memoir is at once diffuse and
perspicuous. There is a life of Titian, in English, by Northcote.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LUTHER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Martin Luther was born at Eisleben in Saxony in the year 1483,
on the 10th of November; and if in the histories of great men it is
usual to note with accuracy the day of their nativity, that of Luther
has a peculiar claim on the biographer, since it has been the especial
object of horoscopical calculations, and has even occasioned some
serious differences among very profound astrologers. Luther has
been the subject of unqualified admiration and eulogy: he has been
assailed by the most virulent calumnies; and, if any thing more were
wanted to prove the <em>personal</em> consideration in which he was held by
his contemporaries, it would be sufficient to add, that he has also
been made a mask for their follies.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was of humble origin. At an early age he entered with zeal into
the Order of Augustinian Hermits, who were Monks and Mendicants.
In the schools of the Nominalists he pursued with acuteness and
success the science of sophistry. And he was presently raised to the
theological chair at Wittemberg: so that his first prejudices were
enlisted in the service of the worst portion of the Roman Catholic
Church; his opening reason was subjected to the most dangerous
perversion; and a sure and early path was opened to his professional
ambition. Such was <em>not</em> the discipline which could prepare the mind
for any independent exertion; such were not the circumstances from
which an ordinary mind could have emerged into the clear atmosphere
of truth. In dignity a Professor, in theology an Augustinian, in
philosophy a Nominalist, by education a Mendicant Monk, Luther
seemed destined to be a pillar of the Roman Catholic Church, and a
patron of all its corruptions.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he possessed a genius naturally vast and penetrating, a memory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>quick and tenacious, patience inexhaustible, and a fund of learning
very considerable for that age: above all, he had an erect and
daring spirit, fraught with magnanimity and grandeur, and loving
nothing so well as truth; so that his understanding was ever prepared
to expand with the occasion, and his principles to change or rise,
according to the increase and elevation of his knowledge. Nature
had endued him with an ardent soul, a powerful and capacious
understanding; education had chilled the one and contracted the
other; and when he came forth into the fields of controversy, he had
many of those trammels still hanging about him, which patience,
and a succession of exertions, and the excitement of dispute, at length
enabled him for the most part to cast away.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1517, John Tetzel, a Dominican Monk, was preaching
in Germany the indulgences of Pope Leo X.; that is, he was publicly
selling to all purchasers remission of all sins, past, present, or future,
however great their number, however enormous their nature. The
expressions with which Tetzel recommended his treasure appear to
have been marked with peculiar impudence and indecency. But the
act had in itself nothing novel or uncommon: the sale of indulgences
had long been recognized as the practice of the Roman Catholic
Church, and even sometimes censured by its more pious, or more
prudent members. But the crisis was at length arrived in which the
iniquity could no longer be repeated with impunity. The cup was at
length full; and the hand of Luther was destined to dash it to the
ground. In the schools of Wittemberg the Professor publicly censured,
in ninety-five propositions, not only the extortion of the Indulgence-mongers,
but the co-operation of the Pope in seducing the
people from the true faith, and calling them away from the only road
to salvation.</p>

<p class='c000'>This first act of Lutherâs evangelical life has been hastily ascribed by
at least three eminent writers of very different descriptions, (Bossuet,
Hume, and Voltaire,) to the narrowest monastic motive, the jealousy
of a rival order. It is asserted that the Augustinian Friars had
usually been invested in Saxony with the profitable commission, and
that it only became offensive to Luther when it was transferred to a
Dominican. There is no ground for that assertion. The Dominicans
had been for nearly three centuries the peculiar favourites of the Holy
See, and objects of all its partialities; and it is particularly remarkable,
that, after the middle of the fifteenth century, during a period
scandalously fruitful in the abuse in question, we very rarely meet
with the name of any Augustinian as employed in that service.
Moreover, it is almost equally important to add, that none of the contemporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>adversaries of Luther ever advanced the charge against
him, even at the moment in which the controversy was carried on
with the most unscrupulous rancour.</p>

<p class='c000'>The matter in dispute between Luther and Tetzel went in the first
instance no farther than thisâwhether the Pope had authority to
remit the divine chastisements denounced against offenders in the present
and in a future stateâor whether his power only extended to
such human punishments, as form a part of ecclesiastical disciplineâfor
the latter prerogative was not yet contested by Luther. Nevertheless,
his office and his talents drew very general attention to the
controversy; the German people, harassed by the exactions, and
disgusted with the insolence of the papal emissaries, declared themselves
warmly in favour of the Reformer; while on the other hand,
the supporters of the abuse were so violent and clamorous, that the
sound of the altercation speedily disturbed the festivities of the
Vatican.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leo X., a luxurious, indolent, and secular, though literary pontiff,
would have disregarded the broil, and left it, like so many others,
to subside of itself, had not the Emperor Maximilian assured him
of the dangerous impression it had already made on the German
people. Accordingly he commanded Luther to appear at the
approaching diet of Augsburg, and justify himself before the papal
legate. At the same time he appointed the Cardinal Caietan, a
Dominican and a professed enemy of Luther, to be arbiter of the
dispute. They met in October, 1518; the legate was imperious;
Luther was not submissive. He solicited reasons; he was answered
only with authority. He left the city in haste, and appealed âto the
Pope <em>better informed</em>,ââyet it was still to the Pope that he appealed,
he still recognized his sovereign supremacy. But in the following
month Leo published an edict, in which he claimed the power of delivering
sinners from <em>all</em> punishments due to every sort of transgression;
and thereupon Luther, despairing of any reasonable accommodation
with the pontiff, published an appeal from the Pope to a General
Council.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pope then saw the expediency of conciliatory measures, and
accordingly despatched a layman, named Miltitz, as his legate, with a
commission to compose the difference by private negotiations with
Luther. Miltitz united great dexterity and penetration with a temper
naturally moderate, and not inflamed by ecclesiastical prejudices.
Luther was still in the outset of his career. His opinions had not yet
made any great progress towards maturity; he had not fully ascertained
the foundations on which his principles were built; he had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>proved by any experience the firmness of his own character. He
yieldedâat least so far as to express his perfect submission to the
commands of the Pope, to exhort his followers to persist in the same
obedience, and to promise silence on the subject of indulgences,
provided it were also imposed upon his adversaries.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is far too much to say (as some have said) that had Lutherâs concession
been carried into effect, the Reformation would have been
stifled in its birth. The principles of the Reformation were too
firmly seated in reason and in truth, and too deeply ingrafted in the
hearts of the German people, to remain long suppressed through
the infirmity of any individual advocate. But its progress might
have been somewhat retarded, had not the violence of its enemies
afforded it seasonable aid. A doctor named Eckius, a zealous satellite
of papacy, invited Luther to a public disputation in the castle of
Pleissenburg. The subject on which they argued was the supremacy
of the Roman pontiff; and it was a substantial triumph for the Reformer,
and no trifling insult to papal despotism, that the appointed
arbiters left the question undecided.</p>

<p class='c000'>Eckius repaired to Rome, and appealed in person to the offended
authority of the Vatican. His remonstrances were reiterated and inflamed
by the furious zeal of the Dominicans, with Caietan at their
head. And thus Pope Leo, whose calmer and more indifferent judgment
would probably have led him to accept the submission of Luther,
and thus put the question for the moment at rest, was urged into
measures of at least unseasonable vigour. He published a bull on the
15th of June, 1520, in which he solemnly condemned forty-one
heresies extracted from the writings of the Reformer, and condemned
these to be publicly burnt. At the same time he summoned the author,
on pain of excommunication, to confess and retract his pretended
errors within the space of sixty days, and to throw himself upon the
mercy of the Vatican.</p>

<p class='c000'>Open to the influence of mildness and persuasion, the breast of
Luther only swelled more boldly when he was assailed by menace and
insult. He refused the act of humiliation required of him; more
than that, he determined to anticipate the anathema suspended over
him, by at once withdrawing himself from the communion of the
church; and again, having come to that resolution, he fixed upon the
manner best suited to give it efficacy and publicity. With this view,
he caused a pile of wood to be erected without the walls of Wittemberg,
and there, in the presence of a vast multitude of all ranks and
orders, he committed the bull to the flames; and with it, the Decree,
the Decretals, the Clementines, the Extravagants, the entire code of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Romish jurisprudence. It is necessary to observe, that he had prefaced
this measure by a renewal of his former appeal to a General Council;
so that the extent of his resistance may be accurately defined: he continued
a faithful member of the Catholic Church, but he rejected the
despotism of the Pope, he refused obedience to an unlimited and
usurped authority. The bull of excommunication immediately followed
(January 6, 1521), but it fell without force; and any dangerous
effect, which it might otherwise have produced, was obviated by the
provident boldness of Luther.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here was the origin of the Reformation. This was the irreparable
breach, which gradually widened to absolute disruption. The Reformer
was now compromised, by his conduct, by his principles, perhaps
even by his passions. He had crossed the bounds which divided insubordination
from rebellion, and his banners were openly unfurled,
and his legions pressed forward on the march to Rome. Henceforward
the champion of the Gospel entered with more than his former
courage on the pursuit of truth; and having shaken off one of the
greatest and earliest of the prejudices in which he had been educated,
he proceeded with fearless independence to examine and dissipate the
rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles V. succeeded Maximilian in the empire in the year 1519;
and since Frederic of Saxony persisted in protecting the person of
the Reformer, Leo X. became the more anxious to arouse the imperial
indignation in defence of the injured majesty of the Church. In
1521 a diet was assembled at Worms, and Luther was summoned to
plead his cause before it. A safe-conduct was granted him by the
Emperor; and on the 17th of April he presented himself before the
august aristocracy of Germany. This audience gave occasion to the
most splendid scene in his history. His friends were yet few, and
of no great influence; his enemies were numerous, and powerful, and
eager for his destruction: the cause of truth, the hopes of religious
regeneration, appeared to be placed at that moment in the discretion
and constancy of one man. The faithful trembled. But Luther
had then cast off the encumbrances of early fears and prepossessions,
and was prepared to give a free course to his earnest and unyielding
character. His manner and expressions abounded with respect and
humility; but in the matter of his public apology he declined in no
one particular from the fulness of his conviction. Of the numerous
opinions which he had by this time adopted at variance with the
injunctions of Rome, there was not one which in the hour of danger
he consented to compromise. The most violent exertions were made
by the papal party to effect his immediate ruin; and there were some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>who were not ashamed to counsel a direct violation of the imperial
safe-conduct: it was designed to re-enact the crimes of Constance,
after the interval of a century, on another theatre. But the infamous
proposal was soon rejected; and it was on this occasion that Charles is
recorded to have replied with princely indignation, that if honour
were banished from every other residence, it ought to find refuge in
the breasts of kings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Luther was permitted to retire from the diet; but he had not proceeded
far on his return when he was surprised by a number of armed
men, and carried away into captivity. It was an act of friendly
violence. A temporary concealment was thought necessary for his
present security, and he was hastily conveyed to the solitary Castle of
Wartenburg. In the mean time the assembly issued the declaration
known in history as the âEdict of Worms,â in which the Reformer
was denounced as an excommunicated schismatic and heretic; and all
his friends and adherents, all who protected or conversed with him,
were pursued by censures and penalties. The cause of papacy
obtained a momentary, perhaps only a seeming triumph, for it was
not followed by any substantial consequences; and while the anathematized
Reformer lay in safety in his secret <em>Patmos</em>, as he used to
call it, the Emperor withdrew to other parts of Europe to prosecute
schemes and interests which then seemed far more important than the
religious tenets of a German Monk.</p>

<p class='c000'>While Luther was in retirement, his disciples at Wittemberg,
under the guidance of Carlostadt, a man of learning and piety, proceeded
to put into force some of the first principles of the Reformation.
They would have restrained by compulsion the superstition of private
masses, and torn away from the churches the proscribed images.
Luther disapproved of the violence of these measures; or it may also
be, as some impartial writers have insinuated, that he grudged to any
other than himself the glory of achieving them. Accordingly, after
an exile of ten months, he suddenly came forth from his place of
refuge, and appeared at Wittemberg. Had he then confined his
influence to the introduction of a more moderate policy among the
reformers, many plausible arguments might have been urged in his
favour. But he also appears, unhappily, to have been animated by a
personal animosity against Carlostadt, which was displayed both then
and afterwards in some acts not very far removed from persecution.</p>

<p class='c000'>The marriage of Luther, and his marriage to a nun, was the event
of his life which gave most triumph to his enemies, and perplexity to
his friends. It was in perfect conformity with his masculine and
daring mind, that having satisfied himself of the nullity of his monastic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>vows, he should take the boldest method of displaying to the world
how utterly he rejected them. Others might have acted differently,
and abstained, either from conscientious scruples, or, being satisfied in
their own minds, from fear to give offence to their weaker brethren; and
it would be presumptuous to condemn either course of action. It is
proper to mention that this marriage did not take place till the year
1525, after Luther had long formally rejected many of the observances
of the Roman Catholic Church; and that the nun whom he espoused
had quitted her convent, and renounced her profession some time before.</p>

<p class='c000'>The war of the peasants, and the fanaticism of Munster and his
followers, presently afterwards desolated Germany; and the papal
party did not lose that occasion to vilify the principles of the reformers,
and identify the revolt from a spiritual despotism with general insurrection
and massacre. It is therefore necessary here to observe, that
the false enthusiasm of Munster was perhaps first detected and
denounced by Luther; and that the pen of the latter was incessantly
employed in deprecating every act of civil insubordination. He was
the loudest in his condemnation of some acts of spoliation by laymen,
who appropriated the monastic revenues; and at a subsequent period
so far did he carry his principles, so averse was he, not only from the
use of offensive violence, but even from the employment of force in
the defence of his cause, that on some later occasions he exhorted
the Elector of Saxony by no means to oppose the imperial edicts by
arms, but rather to consign the persons and principles of the reformers
to the protection of Providence. For he was inspired with a holy
confidence that Christ would not desert his faithful followers; but
rather find means to accomplish his work without the agitation of civil
disorders, or the intervention of the sword. That confidence evinced
the perfect earnestness of his professions, and his entire devotion to
the truth of his principles. It also proved that he had given himself
up to the cause in which he had engaged, and that he was elevated
above the consideration of personal safety. This was no effeminate
enthusiasm, no passionate aspiration after the glory of martyrdom!
It was the working of the Spirit of God upon an ardent nature, impressed
with the divine character of the mission with which it was intrusted,
and assured, against all obstacles, of final and perfect success.</p>

<p class='c000'>As this is not a history of the Reformation, but only a
sketch of the life of an individual reformer, we shall at once proceed
to an affair strongly, though not very favourably, illustrating his
character. The subject of the Eucharist commanded, among the
various doctrinal differences, perhaps the greatest attention; and in
this matter Luther receded but a short space, and with unusual timidity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>from the faith in which he had been educated. He admitted the
real corporeal presence in the elements, and differed from the church
only as to the manner of that presence. He rejected the actual and
perfect change of substance, but supposed the flesh to subsist in, or
with the bread, as fire subsists in red-hot iron. Consequently, he
renounced the term transubstantiation, and substituted consubstantiation
in its place. In the mean time, Zuinglius, the reformer of Zuric,
had examined the same question with greater independence, and had
reached the bolder conclusion, that the bread and wine are no more
than external signs, intended to revive our recollections and animate
our piety. This opinion was adopted by Carlostadt, Åcolampadius,
and other fathers of the Reformation, and followed by the Swiss Protestants,
and generally by the free cities of the Empire. Those who
held it were called Sacramentarians. The opinion of Luther prevailed
in Saxony, and in the more northern provinces of Germany.</p>

<p class='c000'>The difference was important. It was felt to be so by the reformers
themselves; and the Lutheran party expressed that sentiment
with too little moderation. The Papists, or Papalins (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Papalini</span>), were
alert in perceiving the division, in exciting the dissension, and in
inflaming it, if possible, into absolute schism; and in this matter it
must be admitted, that Luther himself was too much disposed by his
intemperate vehemence to further their design. These discords were
becoming dangerous; and in 1529, Philip, Landgrave of Hesse, the
most ardent among the protectors of the Reformation, assembled the
leading doctors of either party to a public disputation at Marpurg.
The particulars of this conference are singularly interesting to the
theological reader; but it is here sufficient to mention, without
entering into the doctrinal merits of the controversy, that whatever
was imperious in assertion and overbearing in authority, and unyielding
and unsparing in polemical altercation, proceeded from the
mouth and party of Luther; that every approach to humility, and
self-distrust, and mutual toleration, and common friendship, came
from the side of Zuinglius and the Sacramentarians. And we are
bound to add, that the same uncompromising spirit, which precluded
Luther from all co-operation or fellowship with those whom <em>he
thought</em> in error (it was the predominant spirit of the church which
he had deserted) continued on future occasions to interrupt and even
endanger the work of his own hands. But that very spirit was the
vice of a character, which endured no moderation or concession in
any matter wherein Christian truth was concerned, but which too
hastily assumed its own infallibility in ascertaining that truth. Luther
would have excommunicated the Sacramentarians; and he did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>perceive how precisely his <em>principle</em> was the same with that of the
church which had excommunicated himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Luther was not present at the celebrated Diet of Augsburg, held
under the superintendence of Charles V. in 1530; but he was in
constant correspondence with Melancthon during that fearful period,
and in the reproofs which he cast on the temporizing, though perhaps
necessary, negotiations of the latter, he at least exhibited his own uprightness
and impetuosity. The âConfessionâ of the Protestants, there
published, was constructed on the basis of seventeen articles previously
drawn up by Luther; and it was not without his counsels that the
faith, permanently adopted by the church which bears his name, was
finally digested and matured. From that crisis the history of the
Reformation took more of a political, less of a religious character,
and the name of Luther is therefore less prominent than in the earlier
proceedings. But he still continued for sixteen years longer to exert
his energies in the cause which was peculiarly his own, and to influence
by his advice and authority the new ecclesiastical system.</p>

<p class='c000'>He died in the year 1546, the same, as it singularly happened, in
which the Council of Trent assembled, for the self-reformation and
re-union of the Roman Catholic Church. But that attempt, even had
it been made with judgment and sincerity, was then too late. During
the twenty-nine years which composed the public life of Luther, the
principles of the Gospel, having fallen upon hearts already prepared
for their reception, were rooted beyond the possibility of extirpation;
and when the great Reformer closed his eyes upon the scene of his
earthly toils and glory, he might depart in the peaceful confidence
that the objects of his mission were virtually accomplished, and the
work of the Lord placed in security by the same heaven-directed hand
which had raised it from the dust.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>RODNEY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This eminent officer was descended from a younger branch of an
ancient family, long resident in the county of Somerset. His father
lived at Walton upon Thames, where George Brydges Rodney,
afterwards Lord Rodney, was born, February 19, 1718. He received
the rudiments of his education at Harrow School, from which he was
removed when only twelve years old, and sent to sea. He gained
promotion rapidly, being made Lieutenant in February, 1739, and
Captain in 1742. He was still farther fortunate in being almost constantly
employed for several years. In the Eagle, of sixty guns,
Captain Rodney bore a distinguished part in the action fought by
Admiral Hawke with the French fleet, off Cape Finisterre, October
14, 1747. The year after he was sent out with the rank of Commodore,
as Governor and Commander-in-Chief on the Newfoundland
station, where he remained till October, 1752.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning to England, he took his seat in Parliament for the
borough of Saltash, and was successively appointed to the Fougueux,
of sixty-four guns, the Prince George, of ninety, and the Dublin,
of seventy-four guns. In the last-named ship he served under
Admiral Hawke in the expedition against Rochefort in 1757, which
failed entirely, after great expense had been incurred, and great
expectations raised; and he assisted at the capture of Louisburg by
Admiral Boscawen in 1758. He was raised to the rank of Rear-Admiral,
May 19, 1759, after twenty-eight years of active and almost
uninterrupted service.</p>

<p class='c000'>In July following he was ordered to take the command of a
squadron destined to attack Havre, and destroy a number of flat-bottomed
boats, prepared, it was supposed, to assist a meditated invasion
of Great Britain. This service he effectually performed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>He was soon raised to a more important sphere of action, being
named Commander-in-Chief at Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands,
in the autumn of 1761. No naval achievement of remarkable brilliance
occurred during the short period of his holding this command: but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>the capture of the valuable islands of Martinique, St. Lucia, and
Grenada, bears testimony to the efficiency of the fleet under his orders,
and the good understanding between the land and sea forces employed
in this service. He was recalled on the conclusion of peace in 1763.
Eight years elapsed before he was again called into service; a period
fruitful in marks of favour from the crown, though barren of professional
laurels. He was created a Baronet soon after his return;
he was raised by successive steps to the rank of Vice-Admiral of the
Red; and he was appointed Governor of Greenwich Hospital. This
office he was required to resign on being again sent out to the West
Indies as Commander-in-Chief at Jamaica in 1771. This was a
period of profound peace: but the duties of peace are often more
difficult, and require more moral courage for their discharge, than
those of war. It is one of Rodneyâs best claims to distinction, that he
suffered none under his command, or within the sphere of his
influence, to neglect their duties with impunity: and in the mode of
carrying on naval affairs then practised in the West Indies, he found
much ground for immediate interference, as well as for representation
and remonstrance to his superiors at home. He earnestly desired to
obtain the government of Jamaica; but on a vacancy occurring in
1773, another person was appointed; and he was recalled, and struck
his flag at Portsmouth, September 4, 1774.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next four years of Sir George Rodneyâs life were much
harassed by pecuniary embarrassment. The habits of a sailorâs life
are proverbially unsuited to strict economy: and moving, when at
home, in the most fashionable society of London, it is no wonder that
his expenses outran his professional gains. He was compelled to retire
to Paris, where he remained until the American war afforded a prospect
of his being called into active service again. In May, 1778, he
was promoted to the rank of Admiral of the White: but it was not
till the autumn of 1779 that he was gratified by being re-appointed to
the command on the Barbadoes station. He sailed from Plymouth
December 29, to enter on the final and crowning scene of his glory.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time Spain and France were at war with England. The
memorable siege of Gibraltar was in progress, and a Spanish fleet
blockaded the Straits. The British navy was reduced unwarrantably
low in point of disposable force; and was farther crippled by a
spirit of disunion and jealousy among its officers, arising partly perhaps
from the virulence of party politics, and partly from the misconduct
of the Admiralty, which threatened even worse consequences than the
mere want of physical force. By this spirit Sir George Rodneyâs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>fleet was deeply tainted, to his great mortification and the great
injury of the country. At first, however, every thing appeared to
prosper. The fleet consisted of twenty-two sail of the line, and eight
frigates. Before Rodney had been at sea ten days, he captured seven
Spanish vessels of war, with a large convoy of provisions and stores;
and on January 16, near Cape St. Vincent, afterwards made memorable
by a more important action, he encountered a Spanish fleet commanded
by Don Juan de Langara, of eleven ships of the line and two
frigates. The superiority of the British force rendered victory certain.
Five Spanish ships were taken, and two destroyed; and had not the
action been in the night, and in tempestuous weather, probably every
ship would have been captured. These at least are the reasons which
Rodney gave in his despatches, for not having done more: in private
letters he hints that he was ill-supported by his captains. Trifling as
this success would have seemed in later times, it was then very acceptable
to the country; and the Admiral received the thanks of both Houses of
Parliament. The scandalous feeling of jealousy of their commander,
ill-will to the ministry, or whatever other modification of party spirit
it was, which could prevent brave men (and such they were) from
performing their duty to the utmost in the hour of battle, broke out
again with more violence when Rodney next came within sight of the
enemy. This was near Martinique, April 17, 1780, about a month
after his arrival in the West Indies. The French fleet, commanded
by the Comte de Guichen, was slightly superior in force. Rodneyâs
intention was to attack the enemyâs rear in close order and with his
whole strength; but his captains disobeyed his orders, deranged his
plan, and careless of the signals for close action, repeatedly made,
kept for the most part at cautious distance from the enemy. His own
ship, the Sandwich, engaged for an hour and a half a seventy-four
and two eighty-gun ships, compelled them to bear away, and broke
completely through the enemyâs line. Not more than five or six ships
did their duty. Had all done it, the victory over De Grasse might have
been anticipated, and the end of the war accelerated perhaps by two
years. In his despatches Rodney censured the conduct of his captains;
but the Admiralty thought proper to suppress the passage. In his
private letters to Lady Rodney, he complains bitterly. One only of
his captains was brought to trial, and he was broken. That ampler
justice was not done on the delinquents, is to be explained by the
difficulty of finding officers to form courts martial, where almost all
were equally guilty. But this partial severity, with the vigorous
measures which the Admiral took to recall others to their duty, produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>due effect, and we hear no more of want of discipline, or reluctance
to engage. For this action Rodney received the thanks of the
House of Commons, with a pension for himself and his family of
Â£2000 per annum.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing of importance occurred during the rest of the spring; and
De Guichen having returned to Europe, Rodney sailed to New
York, to co-operate, during the rainy season in the West Indies, with
the British forces engaged in the American war. In November he
returned to his station. In the course of the autumn he had been
chosen to represent Westminster without expense, and had received the
Order of the Bath. The commencement of the following year was
signalized by acts of more importance. The British ministry had
been induced to declare war against Holland; and they sent out immediate
instructions to Rodney, to attack the possessions of the states
in the West Indies. St. Eustatius was selected for the first blow,
and it surrendered without firing a shot. Small and barren, yet this
island was of great importance for the support which it had long
afforded to the French and Americans under colour of neutrality, and
for the vast wealth which was captured in it. In the course of the
spring, Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice, with the French island
of St. Bartholomew, were also taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the autumn, Rodney returned to Europe for the recovery of
his health. He was received with distinguished favour by the King,
and with enthusiasm by the people, and during his stay, was created
Vice-Admiral of Great Britain, in the place of Lord Hawke, deceased.
He returned in the middle of January, being invested with
the command of the whole West Indies, not merely the Barbadoes
station, as before. The situation of affairs at this time was very critical.
The French fleet, commanded by the Comte de Grasse, consisted of
thirty-three sail<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a> of the line, two fifty-gun ships and frigates, with a
large body of troops, and a train of heavy cannon on board. A powerful
Spanish fleet was also in the West Indies. It was intended to
form a junction, and then with an overwhelming force of near fifty
sail of the line, to proceed to Jamaica, conquer that important island,
and one by one to reduce all the British colonies.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or thirty-four, according to the official list found on board the Ville de Paris after the
engagement.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The French quitted Fort Royal Bay, in Martinique, April 8, 1782.
Intelligence was immediately brought to the British fleet at St. Lucia,
which lost no time in following them. In a partial action on the 9th,
two of the French ships were, disabled. A third was crippled by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>accident on the night of the 11th. Thus, on the morning of the
12th, the decisive day, the French line was reduced to thirty or thirty-one
ships, and numerically the British fleet was stronger: but this
difference was more than compensated by the greater weight of metal
in the French broadside, which was calculated by Sir Charles
Douglas to have exceeded the British by 4396 pounds. On that
morning, about seven oâclock, Rodney bore down obliquely on the
French line, and passed to leeward of it on the opposite tack. His
own ship was the eighteenth from the van: and the seventeen leading
ships having pushed on and taken their position each abreast of an
enemy, Rodney, in the Formidable, broke through the line between
the seventeenth and eighteenth ships, engaged the Ville de Paris, De
Grasseâs flag-ship, and compelled her to strike. The battle was obstinately
fought, and lasted till half-past six in the evening. The loss
of the British in killed and wounded was severe, but disproportionately
less than that of the French. Seven ships of the line and
two frigates fell into the hands of the victors.</p>

<p class='c000'>This battle ruined the power of the allied fleets in the West Indies,
and materially contributed to the re-establishment of peace, which was
concluded in January, 1783. Many other circumstances have combined
to confer celebrity upon it. It restored to Britain the dominion
of the ocean, after that dominion had been some time in abeyance; it
proved the commencement of a long series of most brilliant victories,
untarnished by any defeat on a large scale; and it was the first
instance in which the manÅuvre of breaking through the enemyâs line,
and attacking him on both sides, had been practised. The question
to whom the merit of this invention, which for many years rested with
Lord Rodney, is due, has of late been much canvassed before the
public. It has been claimed for Mr. Clerk, of Eldin, author of a
treatise on Naval Tactics, and for Sir Charles Douglas, Captain of
the Fleet, who served on board the Formidable, and is said to have
suggested it, as a sudden thought, during the action. The claim of
Mr. Clerk appears now to be generally disallowed. The evidence in
favour of each of the other parties is strong and conflicting; and as we
have not space to discuss it, we may be excused for not expressing
any opinion upon it. The claims of Sir Charles Douglas have been
advanced by his son, Sir Howard Douglas, in some recent publications:
the opposite side of the question has been argued in the Quarterly
Review, No. 83. It has also been repeatedly discussed in the United
Service Magazine. It would appear, however, at all events, that
as the final judgment and responsibility rested with the Admiral, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>also should the chief honour of the measure: and it is certain that the
gallant and generous officer for whom this claim has been advanced,
rejected all praise which seemed to him in the least to derogate from the
glory of his commanding officer.</p>

<p class='c000'>A change of ministry had taken place in the spring; and one of
the first acts of the Whigs, on coming into office, was to recall Rodney,
who had always been opposed to them in politics. The officer appointed
to succeed him had but just sailed, when news of his decisive
and glorious victory arrived in England. The Admiralty sent an
express, to endeavour to recall their unlucky step; but it was too late.
Rodney landed at Bristol, and closed his career of service, September 21,
1782. He was received with enthusiasm, raised to the peerage by the
title of Baron Rodney, and presented with an additional pension of
Â£2000 per annum. From this time he lived chiefly in the country,
and died May 23, 1792, in the seventy-fifth year of his age. He
was twice married, and left a numerous family to inherit his well-earned
honours and rewards.</p>

<p class='c000'>The life of Lord Rodney, published by General Mundy, is valuable,
as containing much of his official and private correspondence. The
former proves that his views as a Commander-in-Chief were enlarged,
judicious, and patriotic; the latter is lively and affectionate, and shows
him to have been most amiable in domestic life. Memoirs of his life
and principal actions will be found in most works on naval history
and biography.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LAGRANGE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Joseph Louis Lagrange was born at Turin, January 25th, 1736.
His great-grandfather was a Frenchman, who entered into the service
of the then Duke of Savoy; and from this circumstance, as well as his
subsequent settlement in France, and his always writing in their
language, the French claim him as their countryman: an honour
which the Italians are far from conceding to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The father of Lagrange, luckily perhaps for the fame of his son,
was ruined by some unfortunate speculation. The latter used to say,
that had he possessed fortune, he should probably never have turned
his attention to the science in which he excelled. He was placed at
the College of Turin, and applied himself diligently and with enthusiasm
to classical literature, showing no taste at first for mathematics.
In about a year he began to attend to the geometry of the ancients.
A memoir of Halley in the Philosophical Transactions, on the superiority
of modern analysis, produced consequences of which the author
little dreamed. Lagrange met with it, before his views upon the
subject had settled: and immediately, being then only seventeen
years old, applied himself to the study of the modern mathematics.
Before this change in his studies, according to Delambre<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a>, after it,
according to others, but certainly while very young, he was elected
professor at the Royal School of Artillery at Turin. We may best
convey some notion of his early proficiency, by stating without
detail, that at the age of twenty-three we find himâthe founder of an
Academy of Sciences at Turin, whose volumes yield in interest to
none, and owe that interest principally to his productions,âa member
of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, an honour obtained through
the medium of Euler, who shortly after announced him to Frederic of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Prussia as the fittest man in Europe to succeed himself,âand settling,
finally, a most intricate question<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a> of mathematics, which had given rise
to long discussions between Euler and DâAlembert, then perhaps the
two first mathematicians in Europe. He had previously extended the
method of Euler for the solution of what are called <em>isoperimetrical
problems</em>, and laid the foundation for the <cite>Calculus of Variations</cite>, the
most decided advance, in our opinion, which any one has made since
the death of Newton.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The admissibility of discontinuous functions into the integrals of partial differential
equations.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In 1764 he gained the prize proposed by the Academy of Sciences
for an Essay on the Libration of the Moon; and in 1766, that for an
Essay on the Theory of the Satellites of Jupiter. In the former of
these we find him, for the first time, using the <em>principle of virtual
velocities</em>, which had hitherto remained almost a barren truth, but
which he afterwards made, in conjunction with the principle known
after the name of DâAlembert, the foundation of the whole of mechanical
science.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1766, Euler, intending to return to St. Petersburg, resigned the
situation which he held at the Court of Berlin, that of director of
the physico-mathematical class of the Academy of Sciences. Frederic
offered this place to DâAlembert, who refused it for himself, but joined
with Euler in recommending Lagrange. The King of Prussia
acceded to their suggestion, and Lagrange was invited to establish
himself at Berlin, with a salary equivalent to 6,000 francs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lagrange remained at Berlin till after the death of Frederic. He
here married a lady who was related to him, and who came from Turin
at his request. She died after a lingering illness of several years,
marked by the most unceasing attention on the part of her husband,
who abandoned his pursuits to devote himself entirely to her during
her illness. Nevertheless the period of his sojourn at Berlin is
perhaps the brightest of a life, most years of which, from the age of
eighteen to that of seventy, were sufficient to ensure a lasting reputation.
He here laid the foundation of his Theory of Functions, of his
general method for determining the secular variations of the planetary
orbits; and here he wrote his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MÃ©canique Analytique</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the death of Frederic, he found that science was no longer
treated with the same respect at the Court of Berlin. He had found
from the commencement of his stay there, that foreigners were looked
upon with dislike, and his spirits had not recovered the loss of his
wife. Many advantageous offers were made to him by different courts,
and among the rest by that of France. Mirabeau, who was then at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Berlin, first pointed out to the ministers of Louis XVI. the acquisition
which was in their power. Lagrange removed to Paris in 1787, and
remained there till his death.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was then weary of his pursuits, and it is said that his
<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MÃ©canique Analytique</span></cite>, which he had sent from Berlin to be printed
in Paris, lay unopened by himself for more than two years after its
publication in 1788. He employed himself in the study of ecclesiastical
and other history, of medicine, botany, and metaphysics. When the
discoveries of the chemists changed the theory and notation of their
science, or rather created a science where none existed before, he
threw himself upon the new study with avidity, and declared that they
had made it easy; <em>as easy as algebra</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1792, being then fifty-six years of age, he married Mlle. Lemonnier,
daughter of the astronomer of that name, and daughter, grand-daughter,
and niece of members of the Academy of Sciences. This
lady well deserves honourable mention in every memoir of Lagrange,
for the affectionate care which she took of his declining years.</p>

<p class='c000'>When, after the subversion of the monarchy, a commission was
appointed to examine into the system of weights and measures, Lagrange
was placed at its head. In this post he continued, not being included
in the <em>purification</em>, which three months after its formation, deprived
the commission of the services of Laplace, Coulomb, Brisson, Borda,
and Delambre. He took no part in politics, and appears to have given
no offence to any party; hence, when the government of Robespierre
commanded all foreigners to quit France, an exception was made in his
favour by the committee of public safety. All his friends had advised
him to retire from the country; and the fate of Lavoisier and Bailly
was sufficient to show that scientific talents of the most useful character
were no protection. He now regretted that he had not followed their
advice, and even meditated returning to Berlin. He did not, however,
put this scheme in execution; and as the Normal and Polytechnic
Schools were successively founded, he was appointed to professorships
in both. His <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">LeÃ§ons</span></cite>, delivered to the former institution, appear in
their published series, and among them we find the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">LeÃ§ons sur la
ThÃ©orie des Fonctions</span></cite>, which has since appeared as a separate work.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is almost needless to say, so well as the public know how science
was encouraged under the Consulate and the Empire, that Lagrange
received from Napoleon every possible respect and distinction. The
titles of senator, count of the empire, grand cordon of the legion of
honour, &amp;c. were given to him. It is also gratifying to be able to add
that his abstinence from political engagements has left his memory
unstained by such imputations as, we know not how justly, rest upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>that of Laplace. We might have omitted to state that he belonged
to all the scientific academies of Europe; but that it is necessary,
for the sake of the scientific reputation of this country, to correct
an inadvertence into which the able author of the âLife of Lagrange,â
in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Biographie Universelle</span></cite>, appears to have fallen. He states that
Lagrange was not a member of the Royal Society of London<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a>. The
fact is, that he was elected in 1798, and his name continued on the list
of foreign members all the remainder of his life.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les principales sociÃ©tÃ©s savantes de LâEurope, <em>celle de Londres exceptÃ©e</em>, sâempressÃ¨rent
de dÃ©corer de son nom la liste de leurs membres.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>About the end of March, 1813, Lagrange was seized with a fever,
which caused his death. He had previously been subject to fits of fainting,
in the last of which he was found by Madame Lagrange, having
fallen against the corner of a table. He preserved his senses to the
last, and on the 8th of April conversed for more than two hours with
M.M. Monge, LacepÃ¨de, and Chaptal, who were commissioned by the
Emperor to carry him the grand cordon of the order of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">RÃ©union</span></i>.
He then promised them, not thinking himself so near his end, full
details of his early life. Unfortunately this promise remains unfulfilled,
as he died on the 10th of April, in his seventy-eighth year. His
father had died some years before him at the age of ninety-five,
having had eleven children, all of whom, except the subject of this
memoir, and one other, died young. Lagrange himself had no children.
His private character, as all accounts agree in stating, was most
exemplary. His manners were peculiarly mild, and though occasionally
abstracted and absent, he was fond of society, particularly that
of the young. In the earlier part of his life he was attacked in an
unworthy manner by Fontaine, who at the same time boasted of some
discovery which he attributed to himself. Lagrange replied with the
urbanity which always accompanied his dealings with others, and
while he overthrew the claim of his opponent, he repaid his incivility
by the compliment of admitting that his talents were such as would
have enabled him to attain the discovery, if it had not been previously
made. Such moderation is rare, and as might be expected, it was
accompanied by the utmost modesty in speaking of himself. In the
latter half of his life, it would have been affectation in him to have
denied his own powers, or spoken slightingly of his own discoveries;
nor do we find that he ever did so. In giving opinions or explanations,
he broke off the moment he found that his ideas were not as clear or
his knowledge as definite, as he had thought when he begun; concluding
abruptly with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je ne sais pas, Je ne sais pas</span></i>. Among his
studies, music found a place; but, though pleased with the art, he used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>to assert that he never heard more than three bars: the fourth found
him wrapped in meditation, and by his own account, he solved very
difficult problems in these circumstances. He would, therefore, as
M. Delambre remarks, measure the beauty of a piece of music by the
mathematical suggestions which he derived from it; and his arrangement
of the great masters would be not a little curious.</p>

<p class='c000'>He never would allow a portrait of himself to be taken. A very
well executed bust, which is now in the Library of the Institute, was
made from a sketch by a young Italian artist, sent by the Academy of
Turin. From this bust our portrait is engraved.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the character of Lagrange as a philosopher, no description, in so
few words, can be better than that of M. Laplace: âAmong the
discoverers who have most enlarged the bounds of our knowledge,
Newton and Lagrange appear to me to have possessed in the highest
degree that happy tact, which leads to the discovery of general principles,
and which constitutes true genius for science. This tact, united
with a rare degree of elegance in the manner of explaining the most
abstract theories, is the characteristic of Lagrange.â This power of
generalization distinguishes all that he has written, and the student of the
<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MÃ©canique Analytique</span></cite> is amazed when he comes to a chapter headed
â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Equations DiffÃ©rentielles pour la solution de tous les problÃ¨mes de
Dynamique</span>,â which, on examination, he finds equally applicable, and
equally applied, to the vibrations of a pendulum or the motion of a
planet. On the exquisite symmetry of his notation and style, we need
not enlarge: the mathematician either is acquainted with it, or should
become so with all speed; and others will perhaps only smile at the
notion of one set of algebraical symbols possessing more elegance or
beauty than another.</p>

<p class='c000'>The separate works of Lagrange areâ1. <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MÃ©canique Analytique</span></cite>, the
second edition of which he was engaged upon when he died; the first
edition was published in 1788. 2. <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ThÃ©orie des Fonctions Analytiques</span></cite>,
a system of Fluxions on purely algebraical principles; first edition,

three editions, in 1798, 1808, and 1826. To give only a list of
his separate memoirs would double the length of this life: they will

  <h2 class='c005'>VOLTAIRE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>FranÃ§ois Marie Arouet, who is commonly known by his assumed
name, De Voltaire, was born at ChÃ¢tenay, near Sceaux, February 20,
1694. He soon distinguished himself as a child of extraordinary
abilities. The AbbÃ© de ChÃ¢teauneuf, his godfather, took charge of
the elements of his education, and laboured successfully to improve
the talents of his ready pupil without much regard to his morals.
At three years old the future champion of infidelity had learned by
heart the Moisade, an irreligious poem of J. B. Rousseau. These
lessons were not forgotten at college, where he passed rapidly through
the usual courses of study, and alarmed his Jesuit preceptors by the
undisguised licence of his opinions. About this time some of his first
attempts at poetry obtained for him the notice of Ninon de lâEnclos;
and when the AbbÃ© de ChÃ¢teauneuf, who had been the last in her
long list of favourites, introduced him at her house, she was so pleased
with the promising talents of the boy, that she left him by will a
legacy of 2,000 francs to purchase books. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ecole de Droit</span>, where
Arouet next studied, was much less suited to his disposition than the
College of Louis le Grand. In vain his father urged him to undertake
the drudgery of a profession: the AbbÃ© was a more agreeable
monitor, and under his auspices the young man sought with eagerness
the best Parisian society. At the suppers of the Prince de Conti,
he became acquainted with wits and poets, acquired the easy tone of
familiar politeness, and distinguished himself by the delicacy of his
flatteries, and the liveliness of his repartee. In 1713 he went to
Holland as page to the French ambassador, the Marquis de ChÃ¢teauneuf.
This place had been solicited by his father in the hope of
detaching him from dissipated habits. But little was gained by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>step, for in a short time he was sent back to his family, in consequence
of an intrigue with a M<sup>lle.</sup> Du Noyer, whose mother, a
Protestant refugee at the Hague, gained her living by scandal and
libels, and on this occasion thought something might be got by complaining
to the ambassador, and printing young Arouetâs love-letters.
He was, however, not easily discouraged. He endeavoured to interest
the Jesuits in his affairs, by representing M<sup>lle.</sup> Du Noyer as a ready
convert, whom it would be Catholic charity to snatch from the influence
of an apostate mother. This manÅuvre having failed, he
sought a reconciliation with his father, who remained a long while
implacable; but touched at last by his sonâs entreaties to be permitted
to see him once more, on condition of leaving the country
immediately afterwards for America, he consented to receive him into
favour. Arouet again attempted legal studies, but soon abandoned
them in disgust. The Regency had now commenced; and among the
numerous satires directed against the memory of Louis XIV., one
was attributed to him. The report caused him a yearâs imprisonment
in the Bastille. Soon afterwards he changed the name of Arouet
for that of Voltaire. âI have been unhappy,â he said, âso long as
I bore the first: let us see if the other will bring better fortune.â It
seemed indeed that it did so, for in 1718 the tragedy of Ådipe was
represented, and established the reputation of its author. It had been
principally composed in the Bastille, where he also laid the foundation
of his Henriade, which occupied the time he could spare from amorous
and political intrigue, until 1724. Desiring to publish it, he submitted
the poem to some select friends, men of severe taste, who met at the
house of the President <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Maisons</span>. They found so many faults that
the author threw the manuscript into the fire. The President HÃ©nault
rescued it with difficulty, and said, âYoung man, your haste has cost
me a pair of best lace ruffles: why should your poem be better than
its hero, who was full of faults, yet none of us like him the worse?â
Surreptitious copies spread rapidly, and gained for the author much
both of celebrity and envy. But it displeased two powerful classes:
the priests were apprehensive of its religious, the courtiers of its
political, tendency; insomuch that the publication was prohibited by
government, and the young king refused to accept the dedication. Soon
after this, Voltaire was sent again to the Bastille, in consequence of
a quarrel with the Chevalier de Rohan: and on his liberation, he was
banished to England. There he remained three years, perhaps the
most important era of his life, for it gave an entirely new direction to
his lively mind. Hitherto a wit, and a writer of agreeable verse, he
became in England a philosopher. Returning to France in 1726, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>brought with him an admiration of our manners, and a knowledge of
our best writers, which visibly influenced his own compositions and
those of his contemporaries. He now published several poetical and
dramatic pieces with variable success; but he was more than once
forced to quit Paris by the clamour and persecution of his enemies.
After the failure of one of his plays, Fontenelle and some other
literary associates seriously advised him to abandon the drama, as less
suited to his talent than the light style of fugitive poetry in which he
had uniformly succeeded. He answered them by writing Zaire,
which was acted with great applause in 1732. He had already
published his history of Charles XII.: that of Peter the Great was
written much later in life. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettres Philosophiques</span>, secretly
printed at Rouen, and rapidly circulating, increased his popularity,
and the zeal of his enemies. This work was burnt by the
common hangman. About this time commenced that celebrated
intimacy with Emilie Marquise du ChÃ¢telet, which for nearly twenty
years stimulated and guided his genius. Love made him a mathematician.
In the studious leisure of Cirey, under the auspices of â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la
sublime Emilie</span>,â he plunged himself into the most abstract speculations,
and acquired a new title to fame by publishing the Elements of
Newton in 1738, and contending for a prize proposed by the Academy
of Sciences. At the same time he produced in rapid succession
Alzire, Mahomet, and Merope. His fame was now become European.
Frederic of Prussia, Stanislaus, and other sovereigns honoured him,
or were honoured by his correspondence. But the perpetual intrigues
of his enemies at home deprived him of repose, and even at Cirey he
was not always free from troubles and altercations. Upon the death
of Madame du ChÃ¢telet, in 1749, he accepted the often urged invitation
of Frederic, and took up his residence at the Court of Berlin.
But the friendship of the king and the philosopher was not of long
duration. A violent quarrel with the geometrician, Maupertuis, who
was also living under the protection of Frederic, ended, after some
ineffectual attempts at accommodation, in Voltaireâs departure from
Fredericâs society and dominions (1753). He had just published his
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">SiÃ¨cle de Louis XIV.</span>, which was shortly followed by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essai sur les
MÅurs</span>. After a few more wanderings, for the versatility of his talent
seemed to require a corresponding variety of abode, Voltaire finally
fixed himself at Ferney, near Geneva, in the sixty-fifth year of his
eventful life, and began to enjoy at leisure his vast reputation. From
all parts of Europe strangers undertook pilgrimages to this philosophic
shrine. Sovereigns took pride in corresponding with the Patriarch,
as he was called by the numerous sect of free-thinkers, and self-styled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span><em>philosophers</em>, who looked up to him as their teacher and leader. The
Society of Philosophers at Paris, now employed in their great work,
the EncyclopÃ¦dia, which, from the moment of its ill-judged prohibition
by the government had assumed the character of an antichristian
manifesto, looked up to Voltaire as the acknowledged chief of their
party. He furnished some of the most important articles in the work.
His whole mind seemed now to be bent on one object, the subversion of
the Christian religion. Innumerable miscellaneous compositions, different
in form, and generally anonymous, indeed often disavowed, were
marked by this pernicious tendency. âI am tired,â he is reported to
have said, âof hearing it repeated that twelve men were sufficient to
found Christianity: I will show the world that <em>one</em> is sufficient to
destroy it!â Half a century has elapsed, and the event has not
justified the truth of this boast: he mistook his own strength, as
many other unbelievers have done. These impious extravagances were
not, however, the only occupation of the twenty years which intervened
between Voltaireâs establishment at Ferney and his death. In the
defence of Sirven, Lally, Labarre, Calas, and others, who at several
times were objects of unjust condemnation by the judicial tribunals, he
exerted himself with a zeal as indefatigable as it was meritorious.
Ferney, under his protection, grew to a considerable village, and the
inhabitants learned to bless the liberalities of their patron. His mind
continued to be embittered by literary quarrels, the most memorable
being that with J. J. Rousseau, commemorated in his poem, entitled
â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guerre Civile de GenÃ¨ve</span>â (1768). He hated this unfortunate exile,
as a rival, as an enthusiast, and as a friend, comparatively speaking, to
Christianity. Nor were these his only disquietudes. The publication
of the infamous poem of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Pucelle</span>, which he suffered in strict
confidence to circulate among his intimate friends, and which was
printed by the treachery of some of them, gave him much uneasiness.
For its indecency and impiety he might not have cared: but all who
had offended him, authors, courtiers, even the king and his mistress,
were abused in it in the grossest manner, and Voltaire had no wish
to provoke the arm of power. He had recourse to his usual process
of disavowal, and as he could not deny the whole, he asserted that
the offensive parts had been intercalated by his enemies. In other
instances his zeal outran discretion, and affected his comforts by
producing apprehension for his safety. Sometimes a panic terror of
assassination took possession of him, and it needed all the gentleness
and assiduities of his adopted daughter, Madame de Varicourt, to
whom he was tenderly attached, to bring back his usual levity of
mind. At length, in 1778, Voltaire yielding to the entreaties of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>favourite niece, Madame Denis, came to Paris, where at the theatre
he was greeted by a numerous assemblage in a manner resembling
the crowning of an Athenian dramatic poet, more than any modern
exhibition of popular favour. Borne back to his hotel amidst the
acclamations of thousands, the aged man said feebly, âYou are suffocating
me with roses.â He did not indeed long survive this festival.
Continued study, and the immoderate use of coffee, renewed a strangury
to which he had been subject, and he died May 30, 1778. He
was interred with the rites of Christian worship, a point concerning
which he had shown some solicitude, in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbaye de ScelliÃ¨res</span>.
In 1791 his remains were removed by the Revolutionists, and deposited
with great pomp in the Pantheon.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is difficult within our contracted limits to give an accurate character
of Voltaire. In versatility of powers, and in variety of knowledge,
he stands unrivalled: but he might have earned a better
and more lasting name, had he concentrated his talents and exertions
on fewer subjects, and studied them more deeply. It has
been truly and wittily observed that âhe <em>half knew</em> every thing,
from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop on the wall; and he
wrote of them all, and laughed at them all.â Of the feeling of
veneration, either for God or man, he seems to have been incapable.
He thought too highly of himself to look up to any thing. Capricious,
passionate, and generally selfish, he was yet accessible to
sudden impulses of generosity. He was an acute rather than a subtle
thinker. Perhaps in the whole compass of his philosophical works
there is not to be found one original opinion, or entirely new argument;
but no man ever was endowed with so happy a facility for illustrating
the thoughts of others, and imparting a lively clearness to the most
abstruse speculations. He brought philosophy from the closet into the
drawing-room. Eminently skilled to detect and satirize the faults and
follies of mankind, his love of ridicule was too strong for his love of
truth. He saw the ludicrous side of opinions in a moment, and often
unfortunately could see nothing else. His alchymy was directed
towards transmuting the imperfect metals into dross. All enthusiasm,
eagerness of belief, magnifying of probabilities through the medium
of excited feeling, all that makes a sect as well in its author as its followers,
these things were simply foolish in his estimation. It is impossible
to gather from his works any connected system of philosophy: they
are full of contradictions; but the pervading principle which gives
them some form of coherence is a rancorous aversion to Christianity.
As a Deist believing in a God, â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rÃ©munÃ©rateur vengeur</span>,â but proscribing
all established worship, Voltaire occupies a middle position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>between Rousseau on the one hand, who, while he avowed scepticism
as to the proofs, professed reverence for the characteristics of Revealed
Religion, and Diderot on the other, with his fanatical crew of Atheists,
who laughed not without reason at their Patriarch of Ferney, for
imagining that he, whose life had been spent in trying to unsettle the
religious opinions of mankind, could fix the point at which unbelief
should stop. The dramatic poems of Voltaire retain their place among
the first in their language, but his other poetical works have lost much
of the reputation they once enjoyed. He paints with fidelity and
vividness the broad lineaments of passion, and excels in that light,
allusive style, which brings no image or sentiment into strong relief,
and is therefore totally unlike the analytic and picturesque mode of
delineation, to which in this country, and especially in this age, we
are apt to limit the name and prerogatives of imagination. As a
novelist, he has seldom been equalled in wit and profligacy. As an
historian, he may be considered one of the first who authorized the
modern philosophizing manner, treating history rather as a reservoir
of facts for the illustration of moral science, than as a department of
descriptive art. He is often inaccurate, and seldom profound, but
always lively and interesting. On the whole, however the general
reputation of Voltaire may rise or fall with the fluctuations of public
opinion, he must continue to deserve admiration as</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>RUBENS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The father of this great painter was a magistrate of Antwerp, who,
during the desperate struggle of the Netherlands to shake off the
dominion of Spain, retired from his own city to Cologne, to escape
from the miseries of war. There, in the year 1577, Peter Paul
Rubens was born. At an early age he gave indications of superior
abilities, and his education was conducted with suitable care. The
elder Rubens returned to Antwerp with his family, when that city
passed again into the hands of Spain. It was the custom of that age
to domesticate the sons of honourable families in the houses of the
nobility, where they were instructed in all the accomplishments
becoming a gentleman: and in conformity with it, young Rubens
entered as a page into the service of the Countess of Lalain. The
restraint and formality of this life ill suited his warm imagination
and active mind: and on his fatherâs death, he obtained permission
from his mother to commence his studies as a painter under Tobias
Verhaecht, by whom he was taught the principles of landscape
painting, and of architecture. But Rubens wished to become an
historical painter, and he entered the school of Adam Van Oort, who
was then eminent in that branch of art. This man possessed great
talents, but they were degraded by a brutal temper and profligate
habits, and Rubens soon left him in disgust. His next master was
Otho Van Veen, or Venius, an artist in almost every respect the
opposite of Van Oort, distinguished by scholastic acquirements as
well as professional skill, of refined manners, and amiable disposition.
Rubens was always accustomed to speak of him with great respect and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>affection, nor was it extraordinary that he should have conceived a
cordial esteem for a man whose character bore so strong a resemblance
to his own. From Venius, Rubens imbibed his fondness for
allegory; which, though in many respects objectionable, certainly
contributes to the magnificence of his style. In 1600, after having
studied four years under this master, he visited Italy, bearing letters
of recommendation from Albert, governor of the Netherlands, by
whom he had already been employed, to Vincenzio Gonzaga, duke
of Mantua. He was received by that prince with marked distinction,
and appointed one of the gentlemen of his chamber. He remained at
Mantua two years, during which time he executed several original
pictures, and devoted himself attentively to the study of the works of
Giulio Romano.</p>

<p class='c000'>In passing through Venice, Rubens had been deeply impressed
with the great works of art which he saw there. He had determined
to revisit that city on the first opportunity, and at length
obtained permission from his patron to do so. In the Venetian
school his genius found its proper aliment; but it is perhaps
to Paul Veronese that he is principally indebted. He looked at
Titian, no doubt, with unqualified admiration; but Titian has on all
occasions, a dignity and sedateness not congenial to the gay temperament
of Rubens. In Paul Veronese he found all the elements of his
subsequent style; gaiety, magnificence, fancy disdainful of restraint,
brilliant colouring, and that masterly execution by which an almost
endless variety of objects are blended into one harmonious whole.
Three pictures painted for the church of the Jesuits immediately after
his return to Mantua, attested how effectually he had prosecuted his
studies at Venice. He then developed those powers which afterwards
established his reputation, and secured to him a distinction which he
still holds without a competitor, that of being the best imitator, and
most formidable rival of the Venetian school.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rome, with its exhaustless treasures of art, was still before him,
and he was soon gratified with an opportunity of visiting that capital.
The Duke of Mantua wished to obtain copies of some of the finest
pictures there, and he engaged Rubens to make them, with the double
motive of availing himself of his talents and facilitating his studies.
This task was doubtless rendered light to Rubens, as well by gratitude
towards his patron as by his own great facility of execution.
In this respect Sir J. Reynolds considers him superior to all other
painters; and says that he was âperhaps the greatest master in the
mechanical part of his art, the best workman with his tools, that ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>handled a pencil.â He executed for the Duke copies of several great
works, which could scarcely be distinguished from the originals.
Among his own compositions, painted while at Rome, the most
conspicuous are three in the church of S. Croce in Gerusalemme,
two of which, Christ bearing the Cross, and the Crucifixion, are
considered to rank among his finest productions. There is also, in
the Campidoglio, a picture painted by him at this time, of the finding
of Romulus and Remus, a work of remarkable spirit and beauty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rubens, however, had formed his style at Venice, and was not
induced by the contemplation of the great works at Rome to alter it in
any essential particular. It is not thence to be inferred that he was
insensible to the wonders which surrounded him at Rome; that he did
not appreciate the epic sublimity of Michael Angelo, the pure intelligence
of Raphael; his admiration of ancient sculpture is attested by
his written precepts. Of the antique, certainly, no trace of imitation
is to be found in his works; but perhaps the bold style of design,
which he had adopted in opposition to the meagre taste of his German
predecessors, was confirmed by the swelling outlines of Michael
Angelo. If he imitated Raphael in any thing, it was in composition;
and if in that great quality of art he has any superior, it is in Raphael
alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>The opinion which the Duke of Mantua had formed of Rubensâs
general powers was now evinced in an extraordinary manner. Having
occasion, in 1605, to send an envoy to Spain, he selected Rubens for
the purpose, and directed him to return immediately from Rome to
Mantua, in order to set out on his embassy. The young artist
succeeded equally well as a diplomatist, and as a painter. He executed
a portrait of the King, who honoured him with flattering marks of
distinction, and he fully accomplished the object of his mission.
Shortly after his return to Mantua he revisited Rome, where he contributed
three pictures to the church of S. Maria in Vallicella. In
these the imitation of Paul Veronese is particularly conspicuous. He
next went to Genoa, where he executed several important works, and
was regarded in that city with an interest and respect commensurate
to his high reputation. In the midst of this splendid career, Rubens
received intelligence that his mother, from whom he had been absent
eight years, lay dangerously ill. He hastened to Antwerp, but she
had expired before his arrival. The death of this affectionate parent
afflicted him so severely, that he determined to quit a city fraught
with painful associations, and to take up his future residence in Italy.
But the Duke Albert, and the Infanta Isabella, being anxious to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>retain him in their own territory, he was induced to relinquish his
intention, and finally settled at Antwerp.</p>

<p class='c000'>There he continued to practise during several years, and enriched
Europe, the Low Countries especially, with a surprising number of
pictures almost uniform in excellence. His style, indeed, with all its
admirable qualities, was one in which the delicacies of form and
expression were never allowed to stand in the way of despatch. His
mode of working was to make small sketches, slightly but distinctly;
these were delivered to his scholars, who executed pictures from them
on a larger scale, which they carried forward almost to the final stage,
at which Rubens took them up himself. Thus his own labour was
given only to invention and finishing, the only parts of the art in
which the painterâs genius is essentially exercised. Wherever his
works were dispersed, the demand for them increased, and fortune
poured in on him in a golden flood. Rubensâs mode of living at
Antwerp was the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau idÃ©al</span></i> of a painterâs existence. His house was
embellished with such a collection of works of art, pictures, statues,
busts, vases, and other objects of curiosity and elegance, as gave it
the air of a princely museum. In the midst of these he pursued his
labours, and it was his constant practice while painting to have read
to him works of ancient or modern literature in various languages.
It is a strong testimony to the variety of his powers, and the cultivation
of his mind, that he was well skilled in seven different tongues.
His splendid establishment comprehended a collection of wild beasts,
which he kept as living models for those hunting pieces, and other
representations of savage animals, which have never been surpassed.
Such talents and such success could not fail of exciting envy; a cabal
headed by Schut, Jansens, and Rombouts, endeavoured to detract from
his reputation, and it is amusing to find him accused, among other deficiencies,
of wanting invention! His great picture of the Descent from
the Cross, painted for the Cathedral of Antwerp, and exhibited while
the outcry against him was at its height, effectually allayed it. Snyders
and Wildens were answered in a similar manner. They had insinuated
that the chief credit of Rubensâs landscapes and animals was due to
their assistance. Rubens painted several lion and tiger hunts, and
other similar works, entirely with his own hand, which he did not
permit to be seen until they were completed. In these works he even
surpassed his former productions; they were executed with a truth
power, and energy, which excited universal astonishment, and effectually
put his adversaries to silence. Rubens condescended to give no
other reply to his calumniators; and he showed his own goodness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>heart, by finding employment for those among them whom he understood
to be in want of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1628 he was commissioned by Mary de Medici, Queen of
France, to adorn the gallery of the Luxembourg with a set of pictures,
twenty-four in number, illustrative of the events of her life. Within
three years he completed this magnificent series, in which allegory
mingles with history, and the immense variety of actors, human and
superhuman, with appropriate accompaniments, lays open a boundless
field to the imagination of the artist. The largest of these pictures,
which is the Coronation of Mary de Medici, combines with the
gorgeous colouring proper to the subject, a correctness and chastity
of design seldom attained by Rubens, and is consequently an example
of that high excellence which might be expected from his style when
divested of its imperfections. The gallery of the Luxembourg, as long
as it possessed those ornaments, was considered one of the wonders of
Europe. The pictures are now removed to the Louvre, and are seen
perhaps with diminished effect, among the mass of miscellaneous
works with which they are surrounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two last of the Luxembourg series Rubens finished in Paris.
On his return to the Netherlands his political talents were again
called into requisition, and he was despatched by the Infanta Isabella
to Madrid, to receive instructions preparatory to a negotiation for
peace between Spain and England. Philip IV., and the Duke de
Olivarez, his minister, received him with every demonstration of
regard, nor did they neglect to avail themselves of his professional
skill. The King engaged him to paint four pictures of large dimensions
for the Convent of Carmelites, near Madrid, recently founded
by Olivarez, to whom Philip presented those magnificent works. The
subjects were the Triumph of the New Law, Abraham and Melchizedec,
the four Evangelists, and the four Doctors of the Church,
with their distinctive emblems. He also painted a series of pictures
for the great Saloon of the Palace at Madrid, which represent the
Rape of the Sabines, the Battle between the Romans and Sabines,
the Bath of Diana, Perseus and Andromeda, the Rape of Helen, the
Judgment of Paris, and the Triumph of Bacchus. The Judgment of
Paris is now in the possession of Mr. Penrice, of Great Yarmouth, and
may be considered one of the finest of Rubensâs smaller pictures; the
figures being half the size of life. The King rewarded him munificently,
and conferred on him the honour of knighthood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rubens returned to Flanders in 1627, and had no sooner rendered
an account of his mission to the Infanta, than he was sent by that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>princess to England in order to sound the Government on the subject
of a peace with Spain, the chief obstacle to which had been removed
by the death of the Duke of Buckingham. It is probable that
Rubensâs extraordinary powers as an artist formed one motive for
employing him in those diplomatic functions. The monarchs to
whose courts he was sent were passionate admirers of art; and the
frequent visits which they made to Rubens in his painting room,
and the confidence with which they honoured him, gave him opportunities,
perhaps, in his double capacity, of obviating political difficulties,
which might not otherwise have been so easily overcome. This was
certainly the case in his negotiations with Charles I. He was not,
it appears, formally presented in the character of an envoy. But
the monarch received him with all the consideration due to his
distinguished character; and it was while he was engaged on the
paintings at Whitehall, the progress of which the King delighted to
inspect, that he disclosed the object of his visit, and produced his
credentials. This he did with infinite delicacy and address; and
the King was by no means indisposed to listen to his proposals. A
council was appointed to negotiate with him on the subject of a
pacification, which was soon after concluded. It was on this occasion
that Rubens painted and presented to the King the picture of Peace
and War, which is now in our National Gallery. The relation of
that work to the object of his mission is obvious: the blessings of
peace in contradistinction to the miseries of war are beautifully
illustrated; and whether Rubens paid this compliment to the King
while his negotiations were in progress, or after they were terminated,
a more elegant and appropriate gift was never addressed by a
minister to a monarch. The painter was splendidly remunerated, and
honoured with knighthood by Charles in 1630. The object of his
mission being happily accomplished, he returned to the Netherlands,
where he was received with the distinction due to his splendid genius
and successful services.</p>

<p class='c000'>His various and incessant labours appear to have prematurely
broken his constitution; he had scarcely attained his fifty-eighth year
when he was attacked by gout with more than usual severity. This
painful disease was succeeded by a general debility, which obliged him
to desist from the execution of large works, to relinquish all public
business, and even to limit his correspondence to his particular friends,
and a few distinguished artists. His letters, however, when he touches
on the subject of art, rise into a strain of animated enthusiasm.
He continued to work, but chiefly on small subjects, till the year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>1640, when he died at the age of sixty-three. He was interred with
great splendour in the church of St. James, under the altar of his private
chapel, which he had ornamented with one of his finest pictures.
A monument was erected to his memory by his widow and children,
with an epitaph descriptive of his distinguished talents, the functions
he had filled, and the honours with which he had been rewarded.</p>

<p class='c000'>In extent of range the pencil of Rubens is unrivalled. History,
portrait, landscape under the aspect of every season, animal life in
every form, are equally familiar to him. His hunting pieces
especially, wherein lions, tigers, and other wild animals, with men,
dogs, and horses, are depicted under all the circumstances of fierce
excitement, momentary action, and complicated foreshortenings, are
wonderful. Rubens wanted only a purer style in designing the
human figure, to have been a perfect, as well as a universal painter.
His taste in this particular is singularly unlike that which the habits
of his life seemed likely to produce. He had been bred up in scenes
of courtly elegance, and he was acquainted with whatever was beautiful
in art; yet his conception of character, especially in relation to
feminine beauty, betrays a singular want of refinement. His goddesses,
nymphs, and heroines are usually fat, middle-aged ladies,
sometimes even old and ugly; and they always retain the peculiarities
of individual models. His men too, though not without an air of
portly grandeur, want mental dignity. Faults of such magnitude
would have ruined the fame of almost any other painter; but while
the pictures of Rubens are before us, it is hard to criticise severely
their defects. If, as a colourist, he is inferior to Titian, it is, perhaps,
rather in kind than in degree: Titianâs colouring may be
compared to the splendour of the summer sun; that of Rubens
excites the exhilarating sensations of a spring morning. It is true
that the artifice of his system is sometimes too apparent, whereas,
in Titian, it is wholly concealed; Rubens, however, painted for a
darker atmosphere, and adapted the effect of his pictures to the light
in which they were likely to be seen. Inferior to Raphael in elegance
and purity of composition, he competes with him in fertility and clearness
of arrangement. He drew from Paul Veronese a general idea
of diffused and splendid effect, but he superadded powers of pathos
and expression, to which that artist was a stranger. It is, as
Reynolds justly observes, only in his large works that the genius of
Rubens is fully developed; in these he appears as the Homer of his
art, dazzling and astonishing with poetic conception, with grandeur,
and energy, and executive power.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Of Rubensâs personal character we may speak in terms of high
praise. He bore his great reputation without pride or presumption;
he was amiable in his domestic relations, courteous and affable to all.
He was the liberal encourager of merit, especially in his own art, and
he repaid those among his contemporaries who aspersed him, by
endeavouring to serve them. His own mind was uncontaminated by
envy, for which perhaps little credit will be given him, conscious, as
he must have been, of his own most extraordinary endowments. His
noble admission, however, of Titianâs superiority, when he copied one
of his works at Madrid, attests the magnanimity of his disposition;
and his almost parental kindness to his pupil, Vandyke, shows that
he was equally willing to recognize the claims, and to promote the
success of living genius.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rubensâs greatest works are at Antwerp, Cologne, Paris, Munich,
and Madrid. The paintings at Whitehall might have formed a noble
monument of his powers, but they have suffered both from neglect and
reparation. There are smaller works of his in the National Gallery, the
Dulwich Gallery, and in almost every private collection in this country.</p>

<p class='c010'>The name of Du Plessis was borne by an ancient family of Poitou,
which subsequently acquired by marriage the property and title of
Richelieu. Francois Du Plessis was attached to King Henry III.
while he was yet Duke of Anjou; accompanied him when he became
King of Poland; and was made Grand Provost of his Court, after
his accession to the throne of France. In this capacity he arrested
the followers of Guise, when that duke was assassinated at Blois,
in 1588.</p>

<p class='c000'>Armand Jean Du Plessis, the future cardinal, was the third son of
this dignitary, and was born on the 5th of September, 1585, at Paris,
say his biographers, Aubery and Leclerc; whilst tradition claims this
honour for the family <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chÃ¢teau</span> in Poitou. He received the elements of
education at home, from the Prior of St. Florent; but soon quitted the
paternal mansion, first for the College of Navarre, subsequently for
that of Lisieux. From thence he removed to a military academy,
being intended for the profession of arms. But on his brother, who
was Bishop of LuÃ§on, resolving to quit the world for the cloister,
young Armand was advised to abandon the sword for the gown, in
order that he might succeed to his brotherâs bishopric.</p>

<p class='c000'>He adopted the advice, entered with zeal into the study of theology,
and soon qualified himself to pass creditably through the exercises
necessary to obtain the degree of Doctor in Theology. He already
wore the insignia of his bishopric. But the Popeâs sanction was still
wanting, and was withheld on account of the extreme youth of the
expectant. Resolved to overcome this difficulty, he set off to Rome,
addressed the Pontiff in a Latin oration, and gave such proofs of talent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>and acquirements above his age, that he was consecrated at Rome on
the Easter of 1607, being as yet but twenty-two years of age.</p>

<p class='c000'>This position attained, Richelieu endeavoured to make the utmost
advantage of it. He acquired the good-will of his diocese by rigid
attention to the affairs that fell under his jurisdiction; whilst in
frequent visits to the capital, he sought to acquire reputation by
preaching. In the Estates General of 1614, he was chosen deputy by
his diocese, and was afterwards selected by the clergy of the states to
present their <em>cahier</em> or vote of grievances to the monarch. It was an
opportunity not to be thrown away by the ambition of Richelieu, who
instantly put himself forward as the champion of the Queen Mother
against the cabal of the high noblesse. He at the same time adroitly
pointed out where she might find auxiliaries, by complaining that
ecclesiastics had no longer a place in the public administration, and
were thus degraded from their ancient and legitimate share of influence.
Richelieu was rewarded with the place of Almoner to the Queen; and
he was soon admitted to her confidence, as well as to that of her favourite
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MarÃ©chal DâAncre</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1616 he was appointed Secretary of State; but aware by what
slender tenure the office was held, he refused to give up his bishopric.
This excited not only the animadversions of the public, but the anger
of the favourite. Richelieu offered to give up his secretaryship, but
the Queen could not dispense with his talents. The assassination of the
favourite, however, soon overthrew the influence of the Queen herself.
Still Richelieu remained attached to her, and followed her to Blois:
but the triumphant party dreading his talents for intrigue, ordered him
to quit the Queen, and repair to one of his priories in Anjou. He was
subsequently commanded to retire to his bishopric, and at last exiled
to Avignon. Here he sought to avert suspicion by affecting to devote
himself once more to theological pursuits. During this period he
published one or two polemical tracts, the mediocrity of which proves
either that his genius lay not in this path, or, as is probable, that
his interest and thoughts were elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>The escape of the Queen Mother from her place of confinement,
excited the fears of her enemies, and the hopes of Richelieu. He wrote
instantly to Court, to proffer his services towards bringing about an
accommodation. In the difficulty of the moment, the King and his
favourite accepted the offer. Richelieu was released from exile, and
allowed to join the Queen at AngoulÃªme, where he laboured certainly
to bring about a reconciliation. This was not, however, such as the
Court could have wished. De Luynes, the favourite, accused the Bishop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>of LuÃ§on of betraying him. The Queen sought to regain her ancient
authority; the Court wished to quiet and content her without this
sacrifice; and both parties, accordingly, after seeming and nominal
agreements, fell off again from each other. De Luynes sought a support
in the family of CondÃ©; whilst Mary de Medici, refusing to repair to
Paris, and keeping in her towns of surety on the Loire, flattered the
Huguenots, and endeavoured to bind them to her party. On this
occasion Richelieu became intimately acquainted with the designs and
intrigues and spirit of the Reformers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The division betwixt the King and his mother still continued. The
discontented nobles joined the latter, and flew to arms. This state of
things did not please Richelieu, since defeat ruined his party, and
success brought honour rather to those who fought than to him. He
therefore exerted himself, first to keep away the chief of the nobility
from the Queen, secondly, to bring about an accommodation. The
difficulties were got over by the defeat of the Queenâs forces owing to
surprise, and by the promotion of Richelieu to the rank of Cardinal.
The malevolent coupled the two circumstances together; and even the
impartial must descry a singular coincidence. The event, at least,
proves his address; for when the agreement was finally concluded, it
was found that Richelieu, the negotiator, had himself reaped all the
benefits. He received the cardinalâs hat from the Kingâs hand at
Lyons, towards the close of the year 1622.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not content with this advancement of her counsellor, Mary de
Medici continued to press the King to admit Richelieu to his cabinet.
Louis long resisted her solicitations, such was his instinctive dread of
the man destined to rule him. Nor was it until 1624, after the lapse
of sixteen months, and when embarrassed with difficult state questions,
which no one then in office was capable of managing, that the royal
will was declared admitting Richelieu to the council. Even this grace
was accompanied by the drawback, that the Cardinal was allowed to
give merely his opinion, not his vote.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once, however, seated at the council table, the colleagues of the
Cardinal shrunk before him into ciphers. The marriage of the Princess
Henrietta with the Prince of Wales, afterwards Charles I., was
then in agitation. Richelieu undertook to conduct it, and overcame the
delays of etiquette and the repugnance of Rome. De Vieville, the
Kingâs favourite and minister, venturing to show jealousy of Richelieu,
was speedily removed. The affair of the Valteline had given rise to
endless negotiations. The matter in dispute was the attempt of the
House of Austria to procure a passage across the Grisons to connect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>their Italian and German dominions. France and the Italian powers
had opposed this by protests. Richelieu boldly marched an army,
and avowed in council his determination to adopt the policy and
resume the scheme of Henry IV., for the humiliation of the House of
Austria. The King and his Council were terrified at such a gigantic
proposal: instead of being awed by the genius of Richelieu, as yet
they mistrusted it. Peace was concluded with Spain; on no unfavourable
conditions indeed, but not on such as flattered the new
ministerâs pride.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst these negotiations with Spain were yet in progress, the
Huguenots menaced a renewal of the civil war. Richelieu advised
in the council that their demands should be granted, urging that
whilst a foreign foe was in the field, domestic enemies were better
quieted than irritated. His enemies took advantage of this, and represented
the Cardinal as a favourer of heresy. This charge is continually
brought against those who are indifferent to religious dissensions;
but it is probable that Richelieu did seek at this time to gain
the support of the Protestant party, attacked as he was by a strong
band of malcontent nobles, envious of his rise, and intolerant of his
authority.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole Court, indeed, became leagued against the superiority
and arrogance of the Minister; the most <em>qualified</em> of the noblesse, to
use Auberyâs expression, joined with the Duke of Orleans, the monarchâs
brother, and with the Queen, to overthrow Richelieu. As the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MarÃ©chal DâAncre</span> had been made away with by assassination, so the
same means were again meditated. The Comte de Chalais offered
himself as the instrument: but the mingled good fortune and address
of Richelieu enabled him to discover the plot, and avoid this, and every
future peril.</p>

<p class='c000'>His anchor of safety was in the confidence reposed in him by
Louis XIII. This prince, although of most feeble will, was not without
the just pride of a monarch; he could not but perceive that his former
ministers or favourites were but the instruments or slaves of the
noblesse, who consulted but their own interests, and provided but for
the difficulties of the moment. Richelieu, on the contrary, though
eager for power, sought it as an instrument to great ends, to the consolidation
of the monarchy, and to its ascendancy in Europe. He
was in the habit of unfolding these high views to Louis, who, though
himself incapable of putting them into effect, nevertheless had the
spirit to admire and approve them. Richelieu proposed to render his
reign illustrious abroad, and at home to convert the chief of a turbulent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>aristocracy into a real monarch. It forms indeed the noblest part of
this great statesmanâs character, that he won upon the royal mind, not
by vulgar flattery, but by exciting within it a love of glory and of
greatness, to which, at the same time, he pointed the way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly, through all the plots formed against him, Louis XIII.
remained firmly attached to Richelieu, sacrificing to this ministerâs
preeminence his nobility, his brother Gaston, Duke of Orleans, his
Queen, and finally the Queen Mother herself, when she too became
jealous of the man whom she had raised. As yet however Mary
de Medici was his friend, and Richelieu succeeded in sending his
enemies to prison or to the scaffold. Gaston was obliged to bow the
knee before the Cardinal. And Anne of Austria, who was accused
of having consented to espouse Gaston in case of the Kingâs death,
was for ever exiled from the affections of the monarch, and from any
influence over him. If this latter triumph over the young wife of
Louis, whose enmity certainly the Cardinal had most to fear, was
excited by coldly invented falsehoods, history has scarcely recorded
a more odious crime.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is said that Richelieu himself was enamoured of Anne of Austria,
and that he found himself outrivalled by the Duke of Buckingham.
What credit should be assigned to the existence and influence of such
feelings it is difficult to determine. But certainly a strong and personal
jealousy of Buckingham is to be perceived in the conduct of Richelieu.
Policy would have recommended the minister to cajole rather than
affront the English favourite at a time when the Huguenot party was
menacing and the nobility still indignant. The Cardinal had not
long before concluded the marriage of the Princess Henrietta with
Charles, in order to secure the English alliance, and thus deprive the
Huguenots of a dangerous support. Now he ran counter to these
prudent measures, defied Buckingham, whom he forbade to visit Paris,
and thus united against himself and against the monarchy, two most
powerful enemies, one foreign, one domestic.</p>

<p class='c000'>If Richelieu thus imprudently indulged his passion or his pique, he
redeemed the error by activity and exertion unusual to the age. He
at once formed the project of attacking the Huguenots in their chief
strong-hold of La Rochelle. Buckingham could not fail to attempt
the relief of this sea-port; and the Cardinal anticipated the triumph
of personally defeating a rival. He accordingly himself proceeded to
preside over the operation of the siege. To render the blockade effectual,
it was requisite to stop up the port. The military officers whom
he employed could suggest no means of doing this. Richelieu took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>counsel of his classic reading; and having learned from Quintus
Curtius how Alexander the Great reduced Tyre, by carrying out a
mole against it through the sea, he was encouraged to undertake a
similar work. The great mound was accordingly commenced, and
well-nigh finished, when a storm arose and destroyed it in a single
night. But Richelieu was only rendered more obstinate: he recommenced
the mole, and was seen with the volume of Alexanderâs History
in his hand, encouraging the workmen and overruling the objections of
the tacticians of the army. The second attempt succeeded, the harbour
was blocked up, and the promised aid of England rendered fruitless.
The Cardinal triumphed, for La Rochelle surrendered. In his treatment
of the vanquished, Richelieu showed a moderation seldom
observable in his conduct. He was lenient, and even tolerant towards
the Huguenots, content with having humbled the pride of his rival,
Buckingham.</p>

<p class='c000'>La Rochelle was no sooner taken, and Richelieu rewarded by the
title of Prime Minister, than he resumed those projects of humbling the
House of Austria, in which he had previously been interrupted. A
quarrel about the succession to Mantua afforded him a pretext to
interfere; and he did so, after his fashion, not by mere negotiations,
but by an army. This expedition proved a source of quarrel between
him and the Queen Mother, Mary de Medici, who hitherto had been
his firm and efficient friend. Private and family reasons rendered
Mary averse to the war. Both the French Queens of the House of
Medici had shown the reverence of their family for the princes of the
blood of Austria. Mary, on her accession to the regency, had interrupted
Henry IV.âs plans for humbling the influence of that house.
Richelieuâs endeavour to revive this scheme called forth her opposition.
He was obstinate from high motives; she from petty ones. But she
could not forgive the ingratitude of him whom she had fostered, and
who now dared to thwart and counteract her. The voice of the
conqueror of La Rochelle triumphed in council, and his project
in the field. The French were victorious in Italy, and the minister
equally so over the mind of the monarch.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Mary de Medici could not forgive; and she now openly showed
her hatred of Richelieu, and exerted herself to the utmost to injure him
with the King. Though daily defeating her intrigues, the Cardinal
dreaded her perseverance, and resolved to drag the King with him to
another Italian campaign. Louis obeyed, and the court set out for
the south, the Queen Mother herself accompanying it. Richelieu,
however, did not tarry for the slow motions of the monarch. He flew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>to the army, took upon him the command, and displayed all the abilities
of a great general in out-manÅuvring and worsting the generals
and armies of Savoy. In the mean time Louis fell dangerously ill at
Lyons. His mother, an affectionate attendant on his sick couch,
resumed her former empire over him. At one moment his imminent
death seemed to threaten the Cardinal with ruin. Louis recovered,
however; and his first act was to compel a reconciliation, in form at
least, between the Cardinal and the Queen Mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Kingâs illness, although not so immediately fatal to Richelieu
as his enemies had hoped, was still attended with serious consequences
to him. The French army had met with ill success through the
treachery of the general, Marillac, who was secretly attached to the
Queenâs party: and the failure was attributed to Richelieu.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mary de Medici renewed her solicitations to her son, that he would
dismiss his minister. Louis, it appears, made a promise to that effect;
a reluctant promise, given to get rid of her importunity. Mary calculated
too securely upon his keeping it; she broke forth in bitter
contumely against Richelieu; deprived him of his superintendence over
her household; and treated Madame de Combalet, the Cardinalâs
niece, who had sunk on her knees to entreat her to moderate her anger,
almost with insult. The King was present, and seemed to sanction
her violence; so that Richelieu withdrew to make his preparations for
exile. Louis, dissatisfied and irresolute, retired to Versailles; whilst
Mary remained triumphant at the Luxembourg, receiving the congratulations
of her party. Richelieu in the mean time, ere taking his
departure, repaired to Versailles, and, once there, resumed the
ascendant over the monarch. The tidings of this was a thunderstroke
to Mary and her party, who became instantly the victims of the
Cardinalâs revenge. Marillac was beheaded; and Mary de Medici,
herself at length completely vanquished by her rival, was driven out
of France to spend the rest of her days in exile.</p>

<p class='c000'>Richelieu had thus triumphed over every interest and every personage
that was, or was likely to be, inimical to his sway. The young Queen,
Anne of Austria, and the Queen Mother, Mary de Medici, had alike
been sacrificed to his preeminence; and it appears that he employed
the same means to ruin both. One of the weak points of Louis XIII.
was jealousy of his brother, Gaston, Duke of Orleans, whom he could
never abide. Notwithstanding his sloth, the King assumed the
direction of the Italian army, and went through the campaign, to
prevent Gaston from earning honour, by filling the place of command.
Richelieu made effectual use of this foible; he overcame Anne of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Austria, by bringing proofs that she preferred Gaston to the King;
and he overcame Mary de Medici by a similar story, that she favoured
Gaston, and was paving the way for his succession.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Duke of Orleans was now indignant at his motherâs exile,
and espoused her interest with heat. He intruded upon Richelieu,
menacing him personally; nor did the latter refrain from returning
both menace and insult. Gaston fled to Lorraine, and formed a league
with its duke, and with the majority of the French noblesse, for the
purpose of avenging the wrongs of his mother, and driving from
authority the upstart and tyrannical minister.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trial of Marillac had roused the spirit and indignation even of
those nobles, who had previously respected and bowed to the minister
of the royal choice. This nobleman and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marÃ©chal</span> was seized at the
head of his army, and conveyed, not to a prison, but to Richelieuâs
own country-house at Ruel. Instead of being tried by his Peers or
in Parliament, he was here brought before a Commission of Judges,
chosen by his enemy. He was tried in the Cardinalâs own hall, condemned,
and executed in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place de GrÃ¨ve</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The iniquity of such a proceeding offered a popular pretext for the
nobility to withstand the Cardinal: and they were not without other
reasons. Richelieu not only threatened their order with the scaffold,
but his measures of administration were directed to deprive them of
their ancient privileges, and means of wealth and domination. One
of these was the right of governors of provinces to raise the revenue
within their jurisdiction, and to employ or divert no small portion of it
to their use. Richelieu to remedy this transferred the office of collecting
the revenue to new officers, called the <em>Elect</em>. He tried this in
Languedoc, then governed by the Duc de Montmorenci, a noble of
the first rank, whose example consequently would have weight, and
who had always proved himself obedient and loyal. Moved, however,
by his private wrongs, as well as that of his order, he now joined
the party of the Duke of Orleans. That weak prince, after forming his
alliance with the Duke of Lorraine, had raised an army. Richelieu
lost not a moment in despatching a force which reduced Lorraine, and
humbled its hitherto independent duke almost to the rank of a subject.
Gaston then marched his army to Languedoc, and joined Montmorenci.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MarÃ©chal de BrezÃ©</span>, Richelieuâs brother-in-law, led the royal
troops against them, defeated Gaston at Castelnaudari, and took
Montmorenci prisoner. This noble had been the friend and supporter
of Richelieu, who even called him his son; yet the Cardinalâs
cruel policy determined that he should die. There was difficulty in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>proving before the Judges that he had actually borne arms against
the King.</p>

<p class='c000'>âThe smoke and dust,â said St. Reuil, the witness, ârendered it
impossible to recognize any combatant distinctly. But when I saw
one advance alone, and cut his way through five ranks of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gens-dâarmes</span>,
I knew that it must be Montmorenci.â</p>

<p class='c000'>This gallant descendant of five Constables of France perished on
the scaffold at Toulouse. Richelieu deemed the example necessary,
to strike terror into the nobility. And he immediately took advantage
of that terror, by removing all the governors of provinces, and
replacing them throughout with officers personally attached to his
interests.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having thus made, as it were, a clear stage for the fulfilment of his
great political schemes, Richelieu turned his exertions to his original
plan of humbling the House of Austria, and extending the territories
of France at its expense. He formed an alliance with the great
Gustavus Adolphus, who then victoriously supported the course of
religious liberty in Germany. Richelieu drew more advantage from
the death than from the victories of his ally; since, as the price of
his renewing his alliance with the Swedes, he acquired the possession
of Philipsburg, and opened the way towards completing that
darling project of France and every French statesman, the acquisition
of the Rhine as a frontier.</p>

<p class='c000'>The French having manifested their design to get possession of
Treves, the Spaniards anticipated them; and open war ensued betwixt
the two monarchies. The Cardinal allied with the Dutch, and drew
up a treaty âto free the Low Countries from the cruel servitude in
which they are held by the Spaniards.â In order to effect this, the
French and Dutch were to capture the fortresses of the country, and
finally divide it between them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Richelieuâs views or means were not mature enough to produce
a successful plan of conquest. Surrounded as France was by the
dominions of her rival, she was obliged to divide her forces, attack
on many sides, and make conquests on none. The generals, whom he
was obliged to employ, were remarkable but for servility to him,
and jealousy of each other. The Cardinal de la Valette headed one of
his armies, but with no better success than his lay colleagues. Instead
of crushing Spain, Richelieu endured the mortification of witnessing
the irruption of her troops into the centre of the kingdom, where they
took Corbie, and menaced the very capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a critical moment for Richelieu, who is said to have lost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>courage amidst these reverses, and to have been roused to confidence
by the exhortations of his Capuchin friend and confidant, Father
Joseph. He was obliged on this occasion to relax his severity and
pride, to own that the generals of his choice were little worthy of their
trust, and to call on the old noblesse and the princes of the blood to
lead the French troops to the defence of the country. Both obeyed the
summons, and exerted themselves to prove their worth by the recapture
of Corbie, and the repulse of the Spaniards. The enemies of the
Cardinal were aware how much the ignominy of these reverses, as the
result of his mighty plans, must have abated the Kingâs confidence in
him. They endeavoured to take advantage of the moment, and Louis
seemed not averse to shake off his minister. There was no trusting
the Kingâs intentions, however, and it was agreed to assassinate
Richelieu at Amiens. The Comte de Soissons had his hand on his
sword for the purpose, awaiting but the signal from Gaston; but the
latter wanted resolution to give it, and Richelieu again escaped the
murderous designs of his foes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The character of Louis XIII. left his courtiers without hope. It
was such a general mass of weakness, as to offer no particular weak
point of which they could take advantage. Too cold to be enamoured
of either wife or mistress, his gallantries offered no means of captivating
his favour; nor was he bigot enough to be ruled through his
conscience by priestly confessors. It is singular that the gallant,
peremptory, and able Louis XIV. was governed and influenced by
those means which had no hold upon his weak sire. Still as these
were the received ways for undermining the influence of a dominant
minister, Louis XIII. was assailed through his supposed mistresses,
and through his confessors, to induce him to shake off Richelieu. But
all attempts were vain. The ladies Hauteville and Lafayette, who
had pleased Louis, retired to a convent. His confessors, who had
hinted the impiety of supporting the Dutch and German Protestants,
were turned out of the palace. And the Queen, Anne of Austria, with
whom Louis made a late reconciliation, the fruit of which was the
birth of the future Louis XIV., was exposed to disrespect and insult.
Her apartments and papers were searched by order of the Cardinal,
a letter was torn from her bosom, she was confined to her room, and
menaced with being sent back to Spain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Richelieu in his wars was one of those scientific combatants who
seek to weary out an enemy, and who husband their strength in order
not to crush at once, but to ruin in the end. Such at least were the
tactics by which he came triumphant out of the struggle with Spain.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>He made no conquests at first, gained no striking victories; but he compensated
for his apparent want of success by perseverance, by taking
advantage of defeat to improve the army, and by labouring to transfer
to the crown the financial and other resources which had been previously
absorbed by the aristocracy. Thus the war, though little brilliant at
first, produced at last these very important results. Arras in the north,
Turin in the south, Alsace in the east, fell into the hands of the French;
Rousillon was annexed to the monarchy; and Catalonia revolted
from Spain. Richelieu might boast that he had achieved the great
purposes of Henry IV., not so gloriously indeed as that heroic prince
might have done, but no less effectually. This was effected not so
much by arms as by administration. The foundation was laid for that
martial preeminence which Louis XIV. long enjoyed; and which he
might have retained, had the virtue of moderation been known to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not without incurring great personal perils, with proportionate
address and good fortune, that Cardinal Richelieu arrived at
such great results. The rebellion of the Comte de Soissons, the same
whose project of assassination had failed, menaced the Minister
seriously. In a battle against the royal army, the Count was
completely victorious, an event that might have caused a revolution
in the government, had not fortune neutralized it by his death.
He fell by a pistol-shot, whilst contemplating the scene of victory.
His friends asserted that he was murdered by an emissary of the
Cardinal: according to others, the bullet was accidentally discharged
from his own pistol.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the most remarkable plot which assailed Richelieu, was that of
Cinq-Mars, a young nobleman selected to be the Kingâs favourite, on
account of his presumed frivolity. But he was capable of deep
thoughts and passions; and wearied by the solitude in which the
monarch lived, and to which he was reduced by the Ministerâs monopoly
of all power, he dared to plot the Cardinalâs overthrow. This
bold attempt was sanctioned by the King himself, who at intervals
complained of the yoke put upon him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Great interests were at stake, for Richelieu, reckoning upon the
monarchâs weak health, meditated procuring the regency for himself.
Anne of Austria, aware of this intention, approved of the project of
Cinq-Mars, which of course implied the assassination of the Cardinal.
No other mode of defying his power and talent could have been contemplated.
But Richelieu was on the watch. The Court was then
in the south of France, engaged in the conquest of Roussillon, a situation
favourable for the relation of the conspirators with Spain. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Minister surprised one of the emissaries, had the fortune to seize a
treaty concluded between them and the enemies of France; and with
this flagrant proof of their treason, he repaired to Louis, and forced
from him an order for their arrest. It was tantamount to their condemnation.
Cinq-Mars and his friends perished on the scaffold;
Anne of Austria was again humbled; and every enemy of the Cardinal
shrunk in awe and submission before his ascendency. Amongst them
was the King himself, whom Richelieu looked upon as an equal in
dignity, an inferior in mind and in power. The guards of the Cardinal
were numerous as the Monarchâs, and independent of any authority save
that of their immediate master. A treaty was even drawn up between
king and minister, as between two potentates. But the power and the
pride of Richelieu reached at once their height and their termination.
A mortal illness seized him in the latter days of 1642, a
few months after the execution of Cinq-Mars. No remorse for his
cruelty or abatement of his pride marked his last moments. He summoned
the monarch like a servant to his couch, instructed him what
policy to follow, and appointed the minister who was to be his own
successor. Even in the last religious duties, the same character and
the same spirit were observable. As his cardinalâs robe was a covering
and excuse for all crimes in life, he seemed to think that it exempted
him from the common lot of mortals after death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was the career of this supereminent statesman, who, although
in the position of Damocles all his life, with the sword of the assassin
suspended over his head, surrounded with enemies, and with insecure
and treacherous support even from the monarch whom he served, still
not only maintained his own station, but possessed time and zeal to
frame and execute gigantic projects for the advancement of his country
and of his age. It makes no small part of Henry IV.âs glory that he
conceived a plan for diminishing the power of the House of Austria.
Richelieu, without either the security or the advantages of the king
and the warrior, achieved it. Not only this, but he dared to enter
upon the war at the very same time when he was humbling that aristocracy
which had hitherto composed the martial force of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effects of his domestic policy were indeed more durable than
those of what he most prided himself upon, his foreign policy. The
latter was his end, the former his means; but the means were the
more important of the two. For half a century previous, kings had
been acquiring a sacro-sanctity, a power founded on respect, which
equalled that of Asiatic despots; whilst at the same time their real
sources of power remained in the hands of the aristocracy. From this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>contradiction, this want of harmony betwixt the theoretic and the real
power of monarchs, proceeded a state of licence liable at all times to
produce the most serious convulsions. To this state of things Richelieu
put an end for ever. He crushed the power of the great nobility,
as Henry VII., by very different means, had done before him in
England. He made Louis a sovereign in the most absolute sense;
he reformed and changed the whole system of administration, destroyed
all local authorities, and centralized them, as the term is, in the capital
and the court. We see, accordingly, that it was only the capital which
could oppose Mazarin; all provincial force was destroyed by Richelieu.
He it was, in fact, who founded the French monarchy, such as it
existed until near the end of the eighteenth century, a grand, indeed,
rather than a happy result. He was a man of penetrating and commanding
intellect, who visibly influenced the fortunes of Europe to an
extent which few princes or ministers have equalled. Unscrupulous
in his purposes, he was no less so in the means by which he effected
them. But so long as men are honoured, not for their moral excellences,
but for the great things which they have done for themselves,
or their country, the name of Richelieu will be recollected with respect,
as that of one of the most successful statesmen that ever lived.</p>

<p class='c000'>His measures with respect to commerce were very remarkable. He
proposed to render the French marine as formidable as the French
armies, and chose the wisest means in favouring colonization and commercial
companies for the purpose. The chief part of their successful
settlements in the east and west the French owe to Richelieu. In
financial measures he showed least sagacity, and the disordered state in
which he left this branch of the administration was the principal cause
of the difficulties of his successor.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a patron of letters, Richelieu has acquired a reputation almost
rivalling that of his statesmanship. His first and earliest success in
life had been as a scholar supporting his theses; and, as it is continually
observed that great men form very erroneous judgments of their own
excellences, he ever prided himself especially in his powers as a penman:
it was a complete mistake on his part. He has left a considerable
quantity of theological tracts of trifling merit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not content with his own sphere of greatness, he aspired to the minor
praise of being skilled in the fashionable literature of the day; and
amused himself by composing dramatic pieces, some of which Corneille
was employed to correct. The independence of the poet, and the pride
of the patron, led to a quarrel of which we have given some account in
the life of the great tragedian. In 1635 Richelieu founded the French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Academy. We should expect to find in his political writings traces
of the master-hand of one, who, with a mind of unusual power, had
long studied the subject of which he wrote. But those which are
ascribed to him, for none, we believe are avowed, or absolutely known
to be his, are of unequal merit. The â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MÃ©moires de la MÃ¨re, et
du Fils</span>,â are mediocre, and unworthy of him. The â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Testament Politique
du Cardinal de Richelieu</span>â (the authenticity of which is strongly
contested by Voltaire) bears a much higher reputation as a work upon
Government. La Bruyere has said of it, that the man who had done
such things ought never to have written, or to have written in the
style in which it is written.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are several English lives of Cardinal Richelieu, most of
them published in the seventeenth century, but none which we know
to be of authority. In French, we may recommend the reader to the
life of Aubery. The best account of Richelieu, however, is said to be
contained in the âHistoire de Louis XIII.â by P. Griffet.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>WOLLASTON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>No record of this eminent philosopher has yet appeared, except his
scientific papers, and a few meagre biographical sketches published
shortly after his death. It is to be hoped that some one duly qualified
for the task will become the historian of his life and labours before it
is too late.</p>

<p class='c000'>William Hyde Wollaston was born August 6, 1766. His grandfather
was well known as the author of a work, entitled âThe
Religion of Nature Delineated.â He completed his education at
Caius College, Cambridge. It has been said, in most of the memoirs
of him, that he obtained the honour of being senior wrangler. This
is a mistake, arising from Francis Wollaston, of Sidney, having
gained the first place in 1783. It appears from the Cantabrigienses
Graduati that he did not graduate in Arts; but, with a view to
practising medicine, proceeded to the degrees of M.B. in 1787, and
M.D. in 1793. He was not unversed, however, in mathematical
studies. He first established himself as a physician at Bury St.
Edmunds, in Suffolk; but meeting with little encouragement, removed
to London. Soon after this change of abode, he became a
candidate for the office of physician to St. Georgeâs Hospital, in opposition
to Dr. Pemberton. The latter was elected, and Wollaston, in
a fit of pique, declared that he would abandon the profession, and
never more write a prescription, were it for his own father.</p>

<p class='c000'>He kept to his resolution, hasty and unwise as it may seem; and
from this time forward devoted himself solely to the cultivation of
science. Even in an economical view he had no cause to regret this,
for he acquired wealth by the exercise of his inventive genius. One
single discovery, that of a method by which platinum can be made
ductile and malleable, is said to have produced him about thirty thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>pounds. It has been objected that he derogated from the dignity of
the philosophic character by too keen an eye towards making his
experiments profitable: but in this field, if in any, the labourer is
surely worthy of his reward; and unless it can be shown that he turned
away from any train of discovery, because it did not promise pecuniary
gain, surely not a shadow of blame can be attached to him for profiting
by the legitimate earnings of his industry and talents. That
he was fond of acquiring money, there is good reason to believe; but
there is a story, which has been before told, and which we have
ourselves some reason to consider authentic, which proves that he
could use nobly that which he had gained frugally. A gentleman, in
embarrassed circumstances, requested his interference to procure some
place under government. He replied, âI have lived to sixty without
asking a single favour from men in office, and it is not, after that age,
that I shall be induced to do it, were it even to serve a brother. If
the enclosed can be of any use to you, in your present difficulties, pray
accept it; for it is much at your service.â The enclosure was a
cheque for ten thousand pounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of Wollastonâs peculiarities was an exceeding jealousy of any
person entering his laboratory. âDo you see that furnace?â he once
said to a friend, who had penetrated unbidden to this sacred ground.
âYes.â âThen make a profound bow to it, for this is the first,
and will be the last time of your seeing it.â It is not a necessary
inference, that this dislike to having his processes observed arose from
jealousy either of his fame or his profit: it may have been merely
the result of a somewhat saturnine and reserved temper, which seems
to have shunned unnecessary publicity on all occasions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wollaston was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1793. He
was appointed one of its Secretaries, November 6, 1806. His first
paper, which is on medical subjects, is published in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1797; and, until his death, he continued to be a
frequent contributor. His papers amount in number to thirty-nine,
and must be well examined before a just idea can be formed of
the extent and variety of his scientific knowledge. They embrace
various subjects connected with Pathology, Optics, Electricity, Chemistry,
Crystallography, and mechanical contrivances of various sorts.
He contributed a few papers to other philosophical works. Of the
Geological Society he was an active member, though he sent no
memoirs to its Transactions; and on the first annual meeting of that
body after his death, the president, Dr. Fitton, bore testimony to the
high value of his services to the science of Geology.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>The lives of Wollaston and Davy began and ended nearly at the
same time, and ran parallel to each other; they never crossed. Each
was original, and independent of the other; their minds were unlike,
their processes different, and the discoveries of one never interfered with
those of the other. âThe chemical manipulations of Wollaston and
Davy,â we quote from Dr. Paris, âoffered a singular contrast to each
other, and might be considered as highly characteristic of the temperaments
and intellectual qualities of these remarkable men. Every
process of the former was regulated with the most scrupulous regard
to microscopic accuracy, and conducted with the utmost neatness of
detail. It has been already stated with what turbulence and apparent
confusion the experiments of the latter were conducted; and yet each
was equally excellent in his own style; and as artists, they have not
unaptly been compared to Teniers and Michael Angelo. By long
discipline, Wollaston acquired such power in commanding and fixing
his attention upon minute objects, that he was able to recognize
resemblances, and to distinguish differences, between precipitates
produced by re-agents, which were invisible to ordinary observers, and
which enabled him to submit to analysis the smallest particle of matter
with success. Davy on the other hand obtained his results by an
intellectual process, which may be said to have consisted in the
extreme rapidity with which he seized upon, and applied, appropriate
means at appropriate moments.</p>

<p class='c000'>âTo this faculty of minute observation, which Dr. Wollaston
applied with so much advantage, the chemical world is indebted for the
introduction of more simple methods of experimenting: for the substitution
of a few glass tubes and plates of glass for capacious retorts
and receivers, and for the art of making grains give the results which
previously required pounds. A foreign philosopher once called on
Dr. Wollaston with letters of introduction, and expressed an anxious
desire to see his laboratory. âCertainly,â we replied; and immediately
produced a small tray containing some glass tubes, a blow-pipe, two or
three watch-glasses, a slip of platinum, and a few test bottles.â We
may conclude, however, that this was not the whole of Wollastonâs
apparatus, nor he in this quite ingenuous; and the anecdote forms
another illustration of his dislike to admitting any one into his workroom.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this ingenious turn of mind and love of minute accuracy we owe
several valuable instruments. Of these the most important is his reflective
Goniometer, or angle-measurer, which by calling in the unerring
laws of optics, enables the observer to ascertain within a small limit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>error, the angle contained between two faces of a crystal, and introduced,
in the words of Dr. Fitton, âinto crystallography a certainty and precision,
which the most skilful observers were before unable to attain.â
Another of his contrivances is the sliding Scale of chemical equivalents,
an instrument highly useful to the practical chemist. We also owe
to him the Camera Lucida, which enables persons unacquainted with
drawing, to take accurate sketches of any objects presented to their
view. An amusing and characteristic anecdote of his fondness for
producing great results by small means, is told by Dr. Paris. Shortly
after he had witnessed Davyâs brilliant experiments with the galvanic
battery, he met a brother chemist in the street, and taking him aside,
pulled a tailorâs thimble and a small phial out of his pocket, and
poured the contents of the one into the other. The thimble was a
small galvanic battery, with which he instantly heated a platinum wire
to a white heat.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have already spoken of the profits which he derived from the
manufacture of platinum. This intractable metal, most valuable in the
arts from its extreme difficulty of fusion, and power of resisting almost
all agents, was rendered by these very qualities almost incapable of
being reduced into that malleable form, in which alone it would be
made extensively useful. His method of working it is detailed at
length in his last Bakerian Lecture, published in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1829, and must be read before a person unacquainted
with metallurgy can imagine how tedious and laborious were the processes
by which he succeeded in bringing platinum to bear the hammer.
By an ingenious contrivance, described in the Transactions of 1813, he
drew platinum into wire <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>5000</span></span> of an inch in diameter, highly valuable for
the construction of telescopes; and even reduced some portions to the
inconceivable tenuity of <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>30,000</span></span>. Several of his papers are devoted to the
consideration of platinum, and of the two new metals, palladium and
rhodium, which, in the course of his inquiries, he discovered in small
quantities in the ores of platinum. These also he succeeded in
rendering malleable. Rhodium is remarkable for its hardness, which
has caused it to be used to point the nibs of metallic pens.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the autumn of 1828 Dr. Wollaston suffered from an affection
of the brain, of which he died, December 22, 1828, retaining his faculties
to the last. During the period of his illness, feeling that his life was
precarious, he devoted himself to communicating, by dictation, his
various discoveries and improvements to the world. Five papers by
him were read during the last session of the Royal Society during that
year, in one of which he alludes affectingly to his illness, as obliging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>him to commit his observations to writing more hastily than he
was wont. Another is the Bakerian Lecture on the manufacture of
platinum, already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Previous to his death he invested 1000<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> stock in the name of the
Royal Society, the interest of which he directed to be employed for the
encouragement of experiments in Natural Philosophy. He was never
married, and was Senior Fellow of Caius at his death. He was
privately buried at Chiselhurst in Kent; of which parish his father
had been rector.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Wollastonâs philosophical character is thus described in the
preface to a late edition of Dr. Henryâs âElements of Experimental
Chemistry:âââDr. Wollaston was endowed with bodily senses of
extraordinary acuteness and accuracy, and with great vigour of understanding.
Trained in the discipline of the exact sciences, he had
acquired a powerful command over his attention, and had habituated
himself to the most rigid correctness both of thought and language.
He was sufficiently provided with the resources of the mathematics, to
be enabled to pursue with success profound inquiries in mechanical
and optical philosophy, the results of which enabled him to unfold the
causes of phenomena not before understood, and to enrich the arts
connected with those sciences by the invention of ingenious and
valuable instruments. In chemistry he was distinguished by the
extreme nicety and delicacy of his observations; by the quickness
and precision with which he marked resemblances and discriminated
differences; the sagacity with which he devised experiments and
anticipated their results; and the skill with which he executed the
analysis of fragments of new substances, often so minute as to be
scarcely perceptible by ordinary eyes. He was remarkable, too, for
the caution with which he advanced from facts to general conclusions:
a caution which, if it sometimes prevented him from reaching at once
to the most sublime truths, yet rendered every step of his ascent a
secure station from which it was easy to rise to higher and more
enlarged inductions. Thus these illustrious men, Wollaston and
Davy, though differing essentially in their natural powers and acquired
habits, and moving independently of each other, in different paths,
contributed to accomplish the same great ends, the evolving new
elements; the combining matter into new forms; the increase of
human happiness by the improvement of the arts of civilized life;
and the establishment of general laws that will serve to guide other
philosophers onwards through vast and unexplored regions of scientific
discovery.â</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>BOCCACCIO.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The family of this celebrated writer, who claims a distinguished
place among the founders of Italian literature, came from the village
of Certaldo, in the valley of the Elsa, about twenty miles south-west
of Florence. His father, Boccaccio di Chellino, was a Florentine
merchant, who, in his visits to Paris, became acquainted with a
Frenchwoman, of whom Giovanni Boccaccio, the subject of this
memoir, was born, <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. D.</span></span> 1313. It is uncertain whether Paris or
Florence was the place of his nativity. He commenced his studies at
Florence, under Giovanni da Strada, a celebrated grammarian; but
was apprenticed by his father, when hardly ten years old, to another
merchant, with whom he spent six years in Paris. Attached to
literature, he felt a strong distaste to his mercantile life. He manifested
the same temper after his return to Florence; upon which his
father sent him to Naples, partly upon business, partly because he
thought that mingling in the pleasures of that gay city might neutralize
his sonâs distaste to the laborious profession in which he was engaged.
Robert of Anjou, the reigning king of Naples, encouraged learning,
and his court was the most polished of the age: and during an abode
of eight years in that capital, Boccaccio became acquainted with most
of the learned men of Italy, especially Petrarch, with whom he contracted
a friendship, broken only by death. There also he fell in love
with a lady of rank, whose real name he has concealed under that
of Fiametta. Three persons have been mentioned as the object of his
passion: the celebrated Joanna of Naples, grand-daughter of Robert;
Mary, the sister of Joanna; and another Mary, the illegitimate daughter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>of Robert, who seems to have the best claim to this distinction. It
was at Naples, that Boccaccio, inspired by a visit to Virgilâs tomb,
conceived his first longings after literary fame. He determined to
give up commerce, and devote himself entirely to study; and his
father consented to this change, but only on condition that he should
apply himself to the canon law. This was a new source of annoyance.
For several years he pored over âdry decisions and barren
commentaries,â as he expresses himself; until he obtained his doctorâs
degree, and was left at liberty to follow his own pursuits.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>After remaining some time at Florence he returned to Naples;
where he employed himself in writing prose and verse, the Decameron
and the Teseide. His father died in 1349: and having turned his
inheritance into money, he travelled to Sicily, Venice, and other parts
of Italy, collecting manuscripts, frequenting universities and libraries,
studying Greek under Leontius Pilatus of Thessalonica, astronomy
under Andalone del Negro, and Roman literature and antiquities.
Manuscripts at this time were very costly; and he soon exhausted his
patrimony in these pursuits. He then applied himself to transcribing
works; and, by dint of expense and labour, collected a considerable
library, which he bequeathed to the Augustine friars of Santo
Spirito, at Florence. But his means were inadequate to gratify his
liberal tastes: and at times he found himself in very straitened
circumstances. It is said that he sometimes availed himself of his
skill as a copyist, to eke out his resources. In Petrarch he found a
generous friend and a wise counsellor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boccaccio enjoyed a high reputation among his countrymen for
learning and ability; and he was several times employed by them on
embassies and affairs of state. But of all his missions, the most
pleasing was that of repairing to Padua, to communicate to Petrarch
the solemn revocation of the sentence of exile passed on his father
during the factions of 1302; and to inform him that the Florentines,
proud of such a countryman, had redeemed his paternal property, and
earnestly invited him to dwell in his own land, and confer honour on
its then rising university. Though much affected by this honourable
reparation, Petrarch did not at the time comply with their request.</p>

<p class='c000'>About 1361, a singular circumstance wrought a total change in
Boccaccioâs feelings and mode of life. A Carthusian monk came to
him one day, and stated that father Petroni of Sienna, a monk of the
same order, who had died not long before in the odour of sanctity, had
commissioned him to exhort Boccaccio to forsake his studies, reform
his loose life, and prepare for death. To prove the truth of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>mission, he revealed several secrets, known only to Boccaccio and
Petrarch, to both of whom both the monks were totally unknown.
Terrified at this mysterious communication, Boccaccio wrote to
Petrarch, expressing his resolution to comply with the advice, and
shut himself up in a Carthusian cloister. Petrarchâs answer, which
may be found among his Latin epistles, is full of sound sense. He
tells his friend, that though this disclosure of secrets, supposed to be
unknown to any living soul, appeared a mystery, yet âthere is such
a thing as artifice in imposture which may at times assume the
language of supernatural inspiration; that those who practise arts of
this kind examine attentively the age, the aspect, the looks, the habits
of the man they mean to delude, his theories, his motions, his voice,
his conversation, his feelings, and opinions: and from all these derive
their oracles.â He adds, that as to the prediction of approaching
death, there was no occasion for a message from the next world to say,
that a man past the middle age, and infirm of body, could not expect
to have many years to live: and, in conclusion, advises his friend to
tranquillize his imagination, and to avail himself of the warning towards
leading a more regular life; retaining at the same time his liberty, his
house, and his library, and making a good use even of the heathen
authors in the latter, as many holy men, and the fathers of the church
themselves, had done before him. This letter restored Boccaccio to
reason. He gave up his intention of retiring from the world, and
contented himself with assuming the ecclesiastical dress; and being
admitted to the first gradation of holy orders, he adopted a regular
and studious course of life, and turned his attention to the study
of the Scriptures.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the following year he again visited Naples, but he was disgusted
by the neglect which he experienced; and, in 1363, he went
to Venice, and abode three months with Petrarch. He was sent
twice, in 1365 and 1367, to Pope Urban V. upon affairs of the
republic. In 1373, the Florentines determined to appoint a lecturer
to explain the Divina Commedia of Dante, much of which was even
then obscure or unintelligible without the aid of a comment. Boccaccio
was chosen for this honourable office, with the annual stipend of
one hundred florins. He had long and deeply studied, and knew by
heart almost the whole of that sublime poem, which he had several times
transcribed. He left his written comment on the Inferno, and also a
life of Dante, both of which have been published among his works.
But illness interrupted his lectures, and induced him to resort again
to his favourite country residence at Certaldo. A disorder of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>stomach, aggravated by intense application, terminated his existence,
Dec. 21, 1375, at the age of sixty-two. He was buried in the parish
church of Certaldo, and the following modest inscription, which he
had himself composed, was placed over his tomb:â</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hac sub mole jacent cineres ac ossa Johannis.</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Patria Certaldum, studium fuit alma poesis.</span>â</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A monument was also raised to him in the same church, with an
inscription by Coluccio Salutati, secretary to the republic, an intimate
friend of the deceased. This monument was restored, in 1503,
by Tedaldo, PodestÃ , or justice, of Certaldo, who placed another inscription
under the bust of the deceased. The republic of Florence,
in 1396, voted monuments to be raised in their capital to Boccaccio,
Dante, and Petrarch, but this resolution was not carried into effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>By a will, which was dated the year preceding that of his death,
and which is published among his Latin works, Boccaccio constituted
his two nephews, the sons of his brother Jacopo, his heirs. His library
he left to his confessor, Father Martin of Signa, an Augustin friar,
whom he also appointed his executor, directing, that after the fatherâs
death it should revert to the convent of Santo Spirito at Florence,
for the use of students. A fire which broke out in the convent, in
the year 1471, destroyed this valuable collection, which had cost
the proprietor so many years of labour and care, and in which
he had expended the greater part of his patrimony. Boccaccio
having, in his book <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Genealogia Deorum</span></cite>, quoted several ancient
authors whose works have not reached us, it is supposed that some
of these must have been included in the catastrophe that befel his
library. He has been accused, however, of quoting fictitious authors
in this treatise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boccaccioâs private character was stained by licentiousness. Besides
his Fiammetta, he had several mistresses whom he mentions in his
Ameto. A natural daughter, whose name was Violante, he lost
while she was an infant, and he mourns over her in his eclogues
under the name of Olympia. He had also an illegitimate son who
survived him, but who is not mentioned in his testament.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the latter years of his life, Boccaccio was poor, though not in
absolute want, and his friend Petrarch, who died little more than
one year before him, left him by his will fifty golden florins, âto buy
him a winter pelisse to protect him from cold while in his study at
night,â adding, that if he did no more for Boccaccio, it was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>through want of inclination but want of means. Boccaccio, on his
part, had given Petrarch several works copied by his own hand,
among others, a Latin translation of Homer, Dante, and some works
of St. Augustine.</p>

<p class='c000'>His modest dwelling at Certaldo, in which he died, still remains. The
Princes of the House of Medici protected it by affixing their armorial
ensigns on the outside, with an inscription. A Florentine lady, of
the name of Medici Lenzoni, purchased it in 1822, in order to
preserve it from dilapidation as a relic of departed genius. The
appearance of the house is exactly similar to the sketch given by
Manni a century since, in his life of Boccaccio. It is built of brick,
according to the fashion of the fourteenth century, with a square
turret on one side of it commanding a fine view of the surrounding
hills; one of which is still called by the country people, âthe hill of
Boccaccio,â from a tradition that this was his favourite place of resort
for meditation and study in the summer heats. The grove which
crowned its summit was cut down not long ago. A curious circumstance
is said by Professor Rosellini to have happened some years
before the purchase of the house by the Signora Lenzoni. An old
woman, who tenanted the premises, was busy weaving in a small
room next to the sitting apartment, when the repeated shaking of her
loom brought down part of the wall, and laid open a small recess
hollowed in the thickness of it, from which a large bundle of written
papers tumbled down. The old woman, through ignorance or superstition,
or both, thought it a pious duty to consign the whole of the
MSS. to the flames. Probably many interesting autographs of Boccaccio
have thus been lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>Much has been said about Boccaccioâs tomb being âtorn up and
desecrated by bigots;â and Lord Byron has made this the subject of
his eloquent invective. The story seems, however, to have originated
in mistake. Rosellini has given an authentic account of the whole
transaction. It appears that many years since, after a law had been
passed by the Grand Duke Leopold in 1783, forbidding the burial of
the dead under church pavements, the tomb of Boccaccio, which lay
in the centre of the church of St. James and St. Michael at Certaldo,
covered by a stone bearing his family escutcheon, his effigy, and the
four lines above quoted, was opened. Nothing was found, except a
skull, and a tin tube containing several written parchments, which the
persons present could not understand. What became of these is not
known, perhaps they were destroyed like the MSS. found by the old
woman. The tombstone was purchased by some one on the spot,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>and having since been broken, one fragment alone remains, which the
Signora Lenzoni has recovered and placed inside Boccaccioâs house.
All this is asserted in a notarial document drawn up at Certaldo in
1825, and certified by ocular witnesses then surviving, who were present
at the opening of the vault. But, besides this gravestone, there
was a monument placed high on one of the side-walls of the church,
consisting of Boccaccioâs bust, which is a good likeness, holding with
both his arms against his breast a book, on which is written âDecameron,â
and under the bust are the two inscriptions by Salutati and
Tedaldo, such as Manni transcribed them. To this monument, and
not to the tomb, Byronâs reproach partly applies, for it was of late
years removed by some fanatics from its place, and thrown in a corner
at the end of the church. But the authorities interfered and caused it
to be restored in a more conspicuous position, facing the pulpit, where
it is now to be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boccaccio wrote both in Latin and in Italian, in prose and in verse.
His Latin works are now mostly forgotten, although the author
evidently thought more of them than of his Italian novels. Petrarch
fell into the same mistake with regard to his own productions in
both languages. The language of the country, especially in prose
composition, was then esteemed below the dignity of learned men, and
suited only to works of recreation and amusement. Boccaccio wrote
a book on mythology (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Genealogia Deorum, lib. xv.</span>) which he
dedicated to Hugo, King of Cyprus and Jerusalem, at whose request
he had composed it. He acknowledges that he had derived much
information on the subject from Pietro Perugino, librarian to King
Robert of Naples, an assiduous inquirer after ancient and especially
Greek lore, and who had availed himself in his researches of his
intimacy with the Monk Barlaam, a learned Greek emigrant, residing
in Calabria. Boccaccioâs other Latin works are â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De montium,
sylvarum, lacuum, fluviorum, stagnorum, et marium nominibus,
liber</span>,â a sort of gazetteer. â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De casibus virorum et fÃ¦minarum
illustrium, libri ix.</span>â where he eloquently relates, in the last book, the
tragic catastrophe of the unfortunate Templars who were executed at
Paris in 1310â14; at which his father was present. â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De claris
mulieribus opus</span>,ââand lastly, sixteen â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">EclogÃ¦</span>,â amounting to about
three thousand lines, which have been published with those of
Petrarch and others at Florence in 1504. Boccaccio left a key to the
real personages of these eclogues in a long letter written to the already-mentioned
father Martin of Signa. Both he and Petrarch allude in
these poems to the vices and corruptions of the Papal Court.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Of Boccaccioâs Italian works, the Decameron is that by which his
memory has been immortalized. This book consists of a series of
tales, one hundred in number, ten of which are told on each afternoon
for ten successive days, by a society of seven young women and three
young men, who having fled from the dangers of the plague which
afflicted Florence in 1348, assembled at a villa a short distance from
the town. The stories turn chiefly on amorous intrigues and devices,
disappointments and enjoyments, very broadly narrated; and can by
no means be recommended for indiscriminate perusal. They are
admirably told, and are full of wit and humour; but the pleasantry is
for the most part of a nature which modern manners cannot tolerate.
There are, however, better things than mere loose tales in the Decameron:
several of the stories are unexceptionable; some highly pathetic.
They have furnished many subjects for poetry, and especially for the
drama; as, for instance, the tale of Ginevra, the ninth of the second
day, and the affecting story of Griselda, the last of all. With regard
to the merit of the invention, it is true that some of Boccaccioâs tales
are taken from the â<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cento Novelle Antiche</span>,â one of the oldest books
in the Italian language. But the greater number are original: and
many refer to persons and events well known in Italy, especially in
Tuscany at that time, as is demonstrated by Manni. The skill with
which this multitude of tales is arranged and brought forward, constitutes
one of the chief merits of the work. It has been remarked
that out of a hundred introductions with which he prefaces them, no
two are alike. His narrative is clear; free from metaphors and repetition;
avoiding superfluity as well as monotony, and engaging without
tiring the attention. His descriptions, though minute, are graceful
and lively. Generally humorous, not to say broad, he can, at
pleasure, be pathetic; at pleasure, grave and dignified.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here our praise of this celebrated work must stop. Of its indecencies
we have already spoken. The narrative, though clothed in
decent words, frequently runs in such a strain as no company of
women above the lowest grade of shame would now listen to, much
less indulge in. Bad as this is, a still deeper stain is to be found in
the utter absence of all moral principle, and callousness to all good
feeling. Long planned seduction, breach of hospitality, betrayal of
friendship, all these are painted as fortunate and spirited adventures,
and as desirable objects of attainment. Unlucky husbands are sneered
at; jealousy of honour is censured as stupidity or tyranny. Some of
the female characters are even worse than the male; and the world
of the Decameron is one which no man of common decency or honour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>could bear to live in. Boccaccio saw the mischief he had done, and
was sorry when it was too late. In a letter to Mainardo deâ Cavalcanti,
Marshal of Sicily, he entreated him not to suffer the females of his
family to read the Decameron; because, âalthough education and
honour would keep them above temptation, yet their minds could not
but be tainted by such obscene stories.â</p>

<p class='c000'>He is fond of introducing monks and friars engaged in licentious
pursuits, and exposed to ludicrous and humiliating adventures. He
also at times speaks of the rites of the church in a profane or sarcastic
manner. From this it has been inferred that he was a sceptic or
heretic. The conclusion is erroneous. Like other wits of that ignorant,
superstitious, and debauched age, Boccaccio sneered, reviled, and yet
feared: and while he ridiculed the ministers and usages of the church,
he was employed in collecting relics, and ended his loose tales with
invocations of heaven and the saints. Besides, the secular clergy
themselves bore no love towards the monks and mendicant friars: they
were jealous of the former, and they hated and despised the latter.
From Dante down to Leo X. the dignitaries of the church spoke of
friars in terms nearly as opprobrious as Boccaccio himself. Leo
made public jest of them. Bembo, the secretary of Leo, and a cardinal
himself, and Berni, the secretary to several cardinals, give no more
quarter to them than is given in the Decameron. No wonder then that
laymen should take similar liberties, and that a friar should be regarded,
as Ugo Foscolo observes, as a sort of scape-goat for the sins of the
whole clergy. These considerations may explain how the Decameron
went through several editions, both at Venice and Florence, without
attracting the censures of the Court of Rome. The earliest editions
bear the dates of 1471â2, but these became extremely scarce, since the
fanatic Savanarola had a heap of them burnt in the public square of
Florence in 1497. Of the Valdarfer edition of 1471, only one copy
is known to exist. This has long been an object of interest to book
collectors; and was purchased, at the Roxburgh sale, by the Marquis
of Blandford, for the enormous sum of Â£2260. After the reformation
in Germany, a more watchful censorship was established, and the
Decameron was placed in the list of proscribed books. An expurgated
edition however was allowed to appear, under the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">imprimatur</span></i> of Pope
Gregory XIII. in 1573, in which many passages marked by the
Inquisition were expunged, and laymen were made to take the places
of the clergy in the more indecorous adventures. The MS. from
which this and most of the subsequent editions are taken, was written
by Mannelli, the godson, and friend of Boccaccio, in 1384, nine years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>after the authorâs death. It is now in the Laurentian library at Florence.
Mannelli has copied scrupulously what he calls âthe text,â
whether an autograph of Boccaccio, or an earlier copy, even to its
errors and omissions, noting from time to time in the margin â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic
textus</span>,â or â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">deficiebat</span>,â or â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">superfluum</span>.â It may therefore be presumed
that the author had not put the last finish to his work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boccaccio began the Decameron soon after the plague of 1348, and
seems to have circulated the days, or parts, among his friends as he
completed them. He was a long time in completing the work, which
he seems to have laid aside, and resumed at leisure; and it is believed
that he was eight years employed upon it, and that he wrote the latter
tales about 1356. From that time he seems to have taken no more
notice of it. He never sent it to Petrarch, to whom he was in the
habit of transmitting all his other compositions; and it was only by
accident, many years after, that the poet saw a copy of it. This he
mentions in one of his letters to Boccaccio, and says that he âsupposes
it to be one of his juvenile productions.â Petrarch praised only the
description of the plague, and the story of Griselda. This he translated
into Latin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boccaccioâs other Italian prose works are â<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il Filocopo</span>,â a prose
romance, written at the request of his Fiammetta. It is a dull composition,
far inferior to the Decameron in style, and displaying an
anomalous mixture of Christian and Pagan images and sentiments.
â<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">LâAmorosa Fiammetta</span>â is also a prose romance, in which the lady
relates her passion and grief for the absence of Pamfilo, by which
name the author is supposed to have designated himself. â<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il Corbaccio</span>,â
or the âLabyrinth of Love,â in which he relates his adventures
with a certain widow, the same probably as he has introduced in the
seventh tale of the eighth day of the Decameron. âAmeto,â a drama of
mixed prose and verse. â<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Origine, vita, e costumi di Dante Alighieri</span>,â
the life of Dante already mentioned. Several letters remain, but the
bulk of his correspondence is lost. A life of Petrarch by Boccaccio,
written originally in Latin, has been recently discovered, and published
in 1828 by Domenico Rossetti, of Trieste.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boccaccio wrote a quantity of Italian verse, of which he himself
thought little, after seeing those of Petrarch; and posterity has confirmed
his judgment. His Teseide, a heroic poem, in ottava rima,
may be excepted. This metre, generally adopted by the Italian epic
and romantic poets, he has the merit of having invented. Though
imperfect, and little attractive as an epic poem, the Teseide is
not destitute of minor beauties. Chaucer is indebted to it for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Knightâs Tale, remodelled by Dryden under the name of Palamon
and Arcite.</p>

<p class='c000'>An edition of Boccaccioâs Italian prose works was printed at
Naples, with the date of Florence, in 1723â4, in 6 vols. 8vo.; but a
better edition has been lately published at Florence, corrected after
the best approved MSS. in 13 vols. 8vo. 1827â32.</p>

<p class='c000'>The editions of the Decameron are almost innumerable. The best
and most recent ones are those of Poggiali, 1789â90, in 5 vols. 8vo.;
that of Ferrario, Milan, 1803; that of Colombo, Parma, 1812; all
with copious notes and comments; a small one by Molini, Florence,
1820; and the one by Pickering, London, to which the late Ugo
Foscolo prefixed an elaborate and interesting historical dissertation.
Domenico Maria Manni wrote a âHistory of the Decameron,â
Florence, 1742, in which he has collected a store of curious information
concerning that work and its author.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal biographers of Boccaccio are Filippo Villani, who may
be considered as a contemporary of our author; Giannozzo Mannetti,
Francesco Sansovino, Giuseppe Betussi, Count Mazzuchelli, and lastly,
the Count G. Battista Baldelli, who published a new life of Boccaccio
in 1806 at Florence.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Claude GelÃ©e, commonly called Claude Lorraine, was born in
1600, at the village of Chamagne in Lorraine, of very indigent
parents. He was apprenticed to a pastry-cook; but at the end of
his term of service, whether from disgust at his employment, desire
of change, or perhaps influenced by the love of art, he engaged
himself as a domestic to some young painters who were going to
Italy. On arriving at Rome he was employed as a colour-grinder by
Agostino Tassi, an artist then in high repute whose landscapes are
spirited and free, and particularly distinguished by the taste displayed
in the architectural accompaniments. Tassi first induced him to try
his abilities in painting. His earliest essays were implicit imitations
of his masterâs manner, and evinced no symptom of original genius;
perhaps even in his matured style some indications of Tassiâs influence
may be traced. He continued, as opportunity occurred, to exercise
his pencil, obtaining little notice and still less reward. By degrees
however he succeeded sufficiently to venture on giving up his menial
employment; and having acquired from Tassi a tolerable expertness
in the mechanical part of his profession, he appears from thenceforth
to have given little attention to the works of other painters,
relying on his own discernment and diligent observation of nature.
Many years elapsed, however, before the talents of Claude reached
their full maturity, whence his biographers have inferred that he
owed his excellence rather to industry than genius: as if such excellence
were within the reach of mere application.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He drew with indefatigable diligence, both from antique sculpture
and from the living model, but to little purpose; and he was so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>conscious of his incapacity, that he used to observe, âI sell the landscapes,
and throw the figures into the bargain:â and sometimes he
employed Filippo Lauri and Courtois to insert them. But his figures,
however faulty in themselves, are always well adapted to promote the
harmony of the whole composition; being judiciously placed, and
shaded, illuminated, sharpened out, or rendered indistinct, with nearly
as much skill as is shown in the other parts of the picture. And
not unfrequently, however feebly drawn, they partake of that classical
and poetic air, which Claude, beyond every other landscape painter,
has diffused over his works.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is said, and the circumstances of his early life render it probable,
that he was very deficient in general acquirements. Assuredly
he had no opportunities of becoming a profound scholar, nor in
relation to his art was it necessary that he should; why should he
have sought through the medium of books that imagery which lay
before him in reality? Rome, and its environs, the banks of the
Tiber, and the broad Campagna, supplied his imagination with
the best food, and his pencil with inexhaustible materials. He was
accustomed to spend whole days in the open air, not only studying
Nature in her permanent aspects, but making memorandums of every
accidental and fleeting effect which presented itself to his observation.
Sandrart, who sometimes accompanied Claude in his excursions, relates
that he was accustomed to discourse on the visible phenomena of
nature with the intelligence of a philosopher; not only noting effects,
but explaining their causes with precision and correctness, whether
produced by reflection or refraction of light, by dew, vapour, or other
agencies of the atmosphere. Broad as is his style, he entered minutely
into detail, and made drawings of trees, shrubs, and herbage, marking
all their peculiarities of shape, growth, and foliage. By this practice
he was enabled to represent those objects with undeviating accuracy,
and to express, by a few decided touches, their general character.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amidst the splendour of his general effects, the distinguishing
qualities of objects are never neglected; fidelity is never merged
in manner; and hence it is, that the longer we look at his pictures,
the more vivid is the illusion, the more strongly is the reality of the
represented scene impressed upon us. Combining with his fine imagination
the results of observation thus long and intensely exercised,
he accomplished in his works that union of poetic feeling with
accurate representation of nature, which forms the highest excellence
of art, and in which, as a landscape painter, he stands unrivalled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Claude found in Rome and its neighbourhood the materials of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>scenery, but the combination of them was his own: he selected and
copied portions, but he seldom or never painted individual views from
nature. His favourite effects are those of sunrise and sunset, the periods
at which nature puts on her most gorgeous colouring. Beauty and
magnificence are the characteristics of his compositions: he seldom
aims at sublimity, but he never sinks into dulness. Above all he never
brings mean or offensive objects into prominent view, as is so often the
case in the Dutch pictures. His fore-grounds are usually occupied by
trees of large size and noble character, and temples and palaces, or with
ruins august in their decay. Groves and towers, broad lakes, and the
continuous lines of arched aqueducts enrich the middle space; or a
boundless expanse of Arcadian scenery sweeps away into the blue
mountainous horizon. In his admirable pictures of seaports, he
carries us back into antiquity; there is nothing in the style of the
buildings, the shape of the vessels, or the character of any of the
accompaniments which, by suggesting homely associations, injures the
general grandeur of the effect. The gilded galleys, the lofty quays,
and the buildings which they support, all belong to other times, and
all have the stamp of opulence, magnificence, and power.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Claudeâs subjects are almost uniformly those of morning or
evening, it might naturally be supposed that his works possess an air
of sameness. To remove such an impression, it is only necessary to
look at his pictures side by side. We then perceive that he scarcely
ever repeats himself. The pictures of St. Ursula and the Queen of
Sheba, in the National Gallery, are striking instances of that endless
variety which he could communicate to similar subjects. In each of
these pictures there is a procession of females issuing from a palace,
and an embarkation. The extremities of the canvas are occupied by
buildings, the middle space being assigned to the sea and shipping,
over which the sun is ascending. After the first glance, there is no
resemblance in these pictures. The objects introduced in each are
essentially different in character; in that of the Queen of Sheba
they are much fewer in number; the masses are more broad and
unbroken, and the picture has altogether more grandeur and simplicity
than its companion. Its atmosphere too is different: it is
less clear and golden, and there is a swell on the waves, as if they
were subsiding from the agitation of a recent storm. The picture of
St. Ursula is characterized by beauty. Summer appears to be in its
meridian, and the whole picture seems gladdened by the freshening
influence of morning. The vapoury haze which is just dispersing,
the long cool shadows thrown by the buildings and shipping, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>glancing of the sun-beams on the water, and the admirable perspective,
all exhibit the highest perfection of art. It was thus that Claude,
although he painted only the most beautiful appearances of nature,
diversified his effects by the finest discrimination. Sea-ports such as
these were among his most favourite subjects; and there are none in
which he more excelled: yet perhaps it is with his pastoral subjects
that we are most completely gratified. The Arcadia of the poets
seems to be renewed in the pictures of Claude.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the general character of his genius, Claude bears a strong
affinity to Titian. He resembles him in power of generalization,
in unaffected breadth of light and shadow, and in that unostentatious
execution which is never needlessly displayed to excite wonder,
and which does its exact office, and nothing more. But the
similitude in colour is still more striking. The pictures of both
are pervaded by the same glowing warmth; and exhibit the true
brilliancy of nature, in which the hues of the brightest objects are
graduated and softened by the atmosphere which surrounds them.
The colours by which both produced their wonderful effects were for
the most part simple earths, without any mixture of factitious compounds,
the use of which has been always prevalent in the infancy,
and the decline of art, administering as it does to that unformed or
degenerate taste which prefers gaudiness to truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Claudeâs success raised a host of imitators. He was accustomed,
on sending home the works which he had been commissioned to paint
to make a drawing of each, which he inscribed with the name of the
purchaser, as a means by which the originality of his productions
might be traced and authenticated. He left six volumes of these
drawings at the time of his death, which he called his <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Libri di VeritÃ </span><a id='t139'></a>.
One containing two hundred designs is in possession of the Duke of
Devonshire; these have been engraved by Earlom, and published by
Boydell under the title of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Veritatis</span>. Another of these books
was purchased a few years since in Spain, and brought into this
country; where it came into the possession of Mr. Payne Knight, and
was bequeathed by him to the British Museum. Some of Claudeâs
pictures have been finely engraved by Woollet. There are twenty-eight
etchings extant of landscapes and seaports, by Claudeâs own
hand, executed with the taste, spirit, and feeling which we should
naturally expect.</p>

<p class='c000'>England is rich in the pictures of Claude, some of the finest of
which were imported from the Altieri Palace at Rome, and from the
collection of the Duc de Bouillon at Paris. There are ten in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>National Gallery: the two to which we have adverted, that of St.
Ursula especially, he has perhaps never surpassed. The little picture
of the Death of Procris is also singularly beautiful. The Earl
of Radnorâs Evening, or Decline of the Roman Empire, is one of the
most exquisite of Claudeâs works. The Marquis of Buteâs collection
at Luton, is also enriched by some of the finest specimens of this artist
in England.</p>

<p class='c000'>His private history is entirely devoid of incident. From the time of
his arrival in Italy he never quitted it: and though claimed by the
French as a French artist, he was really, in all but birth, an Italian.
He lived absorbed in his art, and never married, that his devotion to
it might not be interrupted by domestic cares. His disposition was
mild and amiable. He died in 1682, aged eighty-two.</p>

<p class='c000'>For more detailed information we may refer to Sandrart â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Academia

work, â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur les Vies et sur les Ouvrages des plus excellens Peintres
anciens et modernes</span>,â Claude is entirely omitted. The English
reader will find the substance of the information given by Sandrart, in

  <h2 class='c005'>NELSON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The services of our great naval Captain need no long description. The
recollection of them is still fondly cherished by his countrymen, and
they have been worthily commemorated by Mr. Southey, with whose
Life of Nelson few readers are unacquainted. To that most animated
and interesting work, which by its late re-publication in the Family
Library is placed within the reach of every one, we must refer those
who desire fuller information concerning the hero of the Nile,
Copenhagen, and Trafalgar, than is contained in this memoir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Horatio Nelson was born at Burnham Thorpe, in Norfolk, September
29, 1758. His father, the rector of that parish, was burthened
with a numerous family: and it is said to have been more with a view
to lighten that burden than from predilection for the service, that at
the age of twelve he expressed a wish to go to sea, under the care of
his uncle, Captain Suckling. Of his early adventures it is unnecessary
to speak in detail. In 1773 he served in Captain Phippsâs voyage of
discovery in the Northern Polar seas. His next station was the East
Indies; from which, at the end of eighteen months, he was compelled
to return by a very severe and dangerous illness. In April, 1777, he
passed his examination, and was immediately commissioned as second
lieutenant of the Lowestoffe frigate, then fitting out for Jamaica.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunate in conciliating the good-will and esteem of those with
whom he served, he passed rapidly through the lower ranks of his profession,
and was made post-captain, with the command of the Hinchinbrook,
of twenty-eight guns, June 11, 1779, when not yet of age.
In 1782 he was appointed to the Albemarle, twenty-eight; and in
1784 to the Boreas, twenty-eight, in which he served for three years
in the West Indies, and though in time of peace, gave signal proof of
his resolution and strict sense of duty, by being the first to insist on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the exclusion of the Americans from direct trade with our colonies,
agreeably to the terms of the Navigation Act. He had no small
difficulties to contend with; for the planters and the colonial authorities
were united against him, and even the Admiral on the station
coincided with their views, and gave orders that the Americans should
be allowed free access to the islands. Still Nelson persevered.
Transmitting a respectful remonstrance to the Admiral, he seized four
of the American ships, which, after due notice, refused to quit the
island of Nevis; and after a long and tedious process at law, in which
he incurred much anxiety and expense, he succeeded in procuring their
condemnation by the Admiralty Court. Many other ships were condemned
on the same ground. Neither his services in this matter, nor
his efforts to expose and remedy the peculations and dishonesty of the
government agents, in almost all matters connected with naval affairs
in the West Indies, were duly acknowledged by the Government at
home; and in moments of spleen, when suffering under inconveniences
which a conscientious discharge of his duty had brought on him, he
talked of quitting the service of an ungrateful country. In March,
1787, he married Mrs. Nisbet, a West-Indian lady, and in the same
year returned to England. He continued unemployed till January,
1793; when, on the breaking out of the revolutionary war, he was
appointed to the Agamemnon, sixty-four, and ordered to serve in the
Mediterranean under the command of Lord Hood.</p>

<p class='c000'>An ample field for action was now open to him. Lord Hood, who
had known him in the West Indies, and appreciated his merits,
employed him to co-operate with Paoli in delivering Corsica from its
subjection to France; and most laboriously and ably did he perform
the duty intrusted to him. The siege and capture of Bastia was
entirely owing to his efforts; and at the siege of Calvi, during which he
lost an eye, and throughout the train of successes which brought about
the temporary annexation of Corsica to the British crown, his services,
and those of the brave crew of the Agamemnon, were conspicuous.
In 1795 Nelson was selected to co-operate with the Austrian and
Sardinian troops in opposing the progress of the French in the north
of Italy. The incapacity, if not dishonesty, and the bad success of
those with whom he had to act, rendered this service irksome and
inglorious; and his mortification was heightened when orders were
sent out to withdraw the fleet from the Mediterranean, and evacuate
Corsica and Elba. These reverses, however, were the prelude to a
day of glory. On February 13, 1797, the British fleet, commanded
by Sir John Jervis, fell in with the Spanish fleet off Cape St. Vincent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>In the battle which ensued, Nelson, who had been raised to the
rank of Commodore, and removed to the Captain, seventy-four, bore a
most distinguished part. Apprehensive lest the enemy might be
enabled to escape without fighting, he did not hesitate to disobey
signals; and executed a manÅuvre which brought the Captain into
close action at once with four first-rates, an eighty, and two seventy-four-gun
ships. Captain Trowbridge, in the Culloden, immediately
came to his support, and they maintained the contest for near an hour
against this immense disparity of force. One first-rate and one
seventy-four dropped astern disabled; but the Culloden was also
crippled, and the Captain was fired on by five ships of the line at
once; when Captain Collingwood, in the Excellent, came up and
engaged the huge Santissima Trinidad, of one hundred and thirty-six
guns. By this time the Captainâs rigging was all shot away; and she
lay unmanageable abreast of the eighty-gun ship, the S. Nicolas.
Nelson seized the opportunity to board, and was himself among the
first to enter the Spanish ship. She struck after a short struggle;
and, sending for fresh men, he led the way from his prize to board the
S. Josef, of one hundred and twelve guns, exclaiming, âWestminster
Abbey or victory.â The ship immediately surrendered. Nelson
received the most lively and public thanks for his services from the
Admiral, who was raised to the peerage by the title of Earl St. Vincent.
Nelson received the Order of the Bath; he had already been made
Rear-Admiral, before tidings of the battle reached England.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the spring, Sir Horatio Nelson commanded the inner
squadron employed in the blockade of Cadiz. He was afterwards
despatched on an expedition against Teneriffe, which was defeated with
considerable loss to the assailants. The Admiral himself lost his right
arm, and was obliged to return to England, where he languished
more than four months before the cure of his wound was completed.
His services were rewarded by a pension of Â£1,000. On this
occasion he was required by official forms to present a memorial of the
services in which he had been engaged; and as our brief account can
convey no notion of the constant activity of his early life, we quote
the abstract of this paper given by Mr. Southey. âIt stated that he
had been in four actions with the fleets of the enemy, and in three
actions with boats employed in cutting out of harbour, in destroying
vessels, and in taking three towns; he had served on shore with the
army four months, and commanded the batteries at the sieges of
Bastia and Calvi; he had assisted at the capture of seven sail of the
line, six frigates, four corvettes, and eleven privateers; taken and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>destroyed near fifty sail of merchant vessels, and actually been
engaged against the enemy upwards of a hundred and twenty times;
in which service he had lost his right eye and right arm, and been
severely wounded and bruised in his body.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in 1798 Nelson went out in the Vanguard to rejoin Lord St.
Vincent off Cadiz. He was immediately despatched with a squadron
into the Mediterranean, to watch an armament known to be fitting out
at Toulon; the destination of which excited much anxiety. It sailed
May 20, attacked and took Malta, and then proceeded, as Nelson
supposed, to Egypt. Strengthened by a powerful reinforcement, he
made all sail for Alexandria; but there no enemy had been seen or
heard of. He returned in haste along the north coast of the Mediterranean
to Sicily, refreshed the fleet, and again sailed to the eastward.
On nearing Alexandria the second time, August 1, he had the
pleasure of seeing the object of his toilsome cruise moored in Aboukir
Bay, in line of battle. It appeared afterwards that the two fleets
must have crossed each other on the night of June 22.</p>

<p class='c000'>The French fleet consisted of thirteen ships of the line and four
frigates; the British of the same number of ships of the line, and one
fifty-gun ship. In number of guns and men the French had a decided
superiority. It was evening before the British fleet came up. The
battle began at half-past six; night closed in at seven, and the struggle
was continued through the darkness, a magnificent and awful spectacle
to thousands who watched the engagement with eager anxiety. Victory
was not long doubtful. The two first ships of the French line were
dismasted in a quarter of an hour; the third, fourth, and fifth were
taken by half-past eight; about ten, the LâOrient, Admiral Brueyâs flag-ship,
blew up. By day-break the two rear ships, which had not been
engaged, cut their cables and stood out to sea, in company with two
frigates, leaving nine ships of the line in the hands of the British, who
were too much crippled to engage in pursuit. Two ships of the line
and two frigates were burnt or sunk. Three out of the four ships
which escaped were subsequently taken; and thus, of the whole armament,
only a single frigate returned to France.</p>

<p class='c000'>This victory, the most complete and most important then known in
naval warfare, raised Nelson to the summit of glory; and presents and
honours were showered on him from all quarters. The gratitude of
his country was expressed, inadequately in comparison with the
rewards bestowed on others for less important services, by raising him
to the peerage, by the title of Baron Nelson of the Nile, with a pension
of Â£2,000. The Court of Naples, to which the battle of Aboukir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>was as a reprieve from destruction, testified a due sense of their
obligation by bestowing on him the dukedom and domain of Bronte,
in Sicily. From Alexandria Nelson went to Naples, much shattered
in health by the fatigue and intense anxiety which he had experienced
during his long cruise, and suffering from a severe wound in the head,
received in the recent battle. He was most kindly received by Sir
William Hamilton, the British ambassador; and here commenced that
fatal intimacy with the celebrated Lady Hamilton, which ruined his
domestic peace, and led to the only stains upon his public life. Her
influence ruled him in all transactions in which the Neapolitan Court
was interested: and as she sought in all things to gratify the Queen,
to whom she was devotedly attached, the passions and follies of a court
corrupt and childish beyond example, were too often allowed to warp
the conduct of a British Admiral, who hitherto had sought the welfare
of his country, even in preference to his own honour and prospects of
advancement. His best friends saw and lamented the consequences of
his weakness, and remonstrated, but to no purpose; and he himself,
unable to control this passion, or to stifle the uneasy feelings to which
it gave birth, appears from his private letters to have been thoroughly
unhappy. Overpowering that influence must have been, when it
could induce the gallant and generous Nelson to annul a treaty of
surrender concluded with the Neapolitan revolutionists, under the joint
authority of the Neapolitan Royalist General, and the British Captain
commanding in the Bay of Naples, and to deliver up the prisoners to
the vengeance of the court, on the sole plea that he would grant
no terms to rebels but those of unconditional submission.</p>

<p class='c000'>The autumn of 1798, the whole of 1799, and part of 1800, Nelson
spent in the Mediterranean, employed in the recovery of Malta, in
protecting Sicily, and in co-operating to expel the French from the
Neapolitan continental dominions. In 1800 various causes of discontent
led him to solicit leave to return to England, where he was
received with the enthusiasm due to his services.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon afterwards, still mastered by his passion, he separated himself
formally from Lady Nelson. In March, 1801, he sailed as second in
command of the expedition against Copenhagen, led by Sir Hyde
Parker. The dilatoriness with which it was conducted increased the
difficulties of this enterprise; and might have caused it to fail, had not
Nelsonâs energy and talent been at hand to overcome the obstacles
occasioned by this delay. The attack was intrusted to him by Sir Hyde
Parker, and executed April 2, with his usual promptitude and success.
After a fierce engagement, with great slaughter on both sides, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>greater part of the Danish line of defence was captured or silenced.
Nelson then sent a flag of truce on shore, and an armistice was concluded.
He bore honourable testimony to the gallantry of his opponents.
âThe French,â he said, âfought bravely, but they could not
have supported for one hour the fight which the Danes had supported
for four.â May 5, Sir Hyde Parker was recalled, and Nelson
appointed Commander-in-Chief: but no further hostilities occurred,
and suffering greatly from the climate, he almost immediately returned
home. For this battle he was raised to the rank of Viscount.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time much alarm prevailed with respect to the meditated
invasion of England; and the command of the coast from Orfordness
to Beachy Head was offered to him, and accepted. But he
thought the alarm idle; he felt the service to be irksome; and gladly
retired from it at the peace of Amiens. When war was renewed in
1803, he took the command of the Mediterranean fleet. For more than
a year he kept his station off Toulon, eagerly watching for the French
fleet. In January, 1805, it put to sea, and escaped the observation of
his look-out ships. He made for Egypt, and failing to meet with them,
returned to Malta, where he found information that they had been
dispersed in a gale, and forced to put back to Toulon. Villeneuve put
to sea again, March 31, formed a junction with the Spanish fleet in
Cadiz, and sailed for the West Indies. Thither Nelson followed him,
after considerable delay for want of information and from contrary
winds; but the enemy still eluded his pursuit, and he was obliged to
retrace his anxious course to Europe, without the longed-for meeting,
and with no other satisfaction than that of having frustrated by his
diligence their designs on our colonies. June 20, 1805, he landed at
Gibraltar, that being the first time that he had set foot ashore since
June 16, 1803. After cruising in search of the enemy till the middle
of August, he was ordered to Portsmouth, where he learned that an
indecisive action had taken place between the combined fleets returning
from the West Indies, and the British under Sir Robert Calder.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had not been many days established at home before certain news
arrived that the French and Spanish fleets had entered Cadiz. Eager
to gain the reward of his long watchings, and laborious pursuit, he
again offered his services, which were gladly accepted. He embarked
at Portsmouth, September 14, 1805, on board the Victory, to take the
command of the fleet lying off Cadiz under Admiral Collingwood, his
early friend and companion in the race of fame. The last battle in
which Nelson was engaged was fought off Cape Trafalgar, October 21,
1805. The enemy were superior in number of ships, and still more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>in size and weight of metal. Nelson bore down on them in two lines;
heading one himself, while Collingwood in the Royal Sovereign led
the other, which first entered into action. âSee,â cried Nelson, as
the Royal Sovereign cut through the centre of the enemyâs line, and
muzzle to muzzle engaged a three-decker; âsee how that noble fellow
Collingwood carries his ship into action.â Collingwood on the other
hand said to his Captain, âRotherham, what would Nelson give
to be here.â As the Victory approached an incessant raking fire
was directed against her, by which fifty of her men were killed and
wounded before a single gun was returned. Nelson steered for his old
opponent at Cape St. Vincent, the Santissima Trinidad, distinguished
by her size, and opened his fire at four minutes after twelve, engaging
the Redoutable with his starboard, the Santissima Trinidad and Bucentaur
with his larboard guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>About a quarter past one, a musket-ball, fired from the mizen-top
of the Redoutable, struck him on the left shoulder, and he fell. From
the first he felt the wound to be mortal. He suffered intense pain,
yet still preserved the liveliest interest in the fate of the action; and
the joy visible in his countenance as often as the hurrahs of the crew
announced that an enemy had struck, testified how near his heart, even
in the agonies of death, was the accomplishment of the great work to
which his life had been devoted. He lived to know that his victory
was complete and glorious, and expired tranquilly at half-past four.
His last words were, âThank God, I have done my duty.â</p>

<p class='c000'>He had indeed done his duty, and completed his task; for thenceforth
no hostile fleet presumed to contest the dominion of the sea. It
may seem mournful, that he did not survive to enjoy the thanks and
honours with which a grateful country would have rejoiced to recompense
this crowning triumph. But he had reached the pinnacle of
fame; and his death in the hour of victory has tended far more than
a few years of peaceful life, to keep alive his memory in the hearts
of a people which loved, and a navy which adored him. In the
eloquent words of the distinguished author from whom this sketch is
compiled, âHe cannot be said to have fallen prematurely whose work
was done; nor ought he to be lamented, who died so full of honours,
and at the height of human fame. The most triumphant death is that
of the martyr: the most awful, that of the martyred patriot: the most
splendid, that of the hero in the hour of victory. He has left us a
name and an example which are at this hour inspiring thousands of
the youth of England: a name which is our pride, and an example
which will continue to be our shield and our strength.â</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>A few words, before we conclude, on those points which appear to
us to have constituted the peculiar excellence of Nelsonâs character,
the real source of his greatness. We cannot attribute it solely to
personal courage, or professional skill: fearless as he was, the navy
contained thousands of hearts as fearless as his own; skilful as he
was, there may have been other officers not less skilful than himself.
But to courage, talent, and a thorough knowledge of nautical affairs,
he joined a degree of political and moral courage, and disinterestedness
rarely equalled. To do his duty seems always to have been
his first object: not to do all that was required, but all that could
be done. With this view he never hesitated to run the risk of professional
censure when the emergency seemed to demand it. Many
instances are on record in which he acted contrary to orders: some,
when he knew that strict obedience would have been mischievous,
in circumstances which the framers of the orders could not have
foreseen: others where he disobeyed the commands of a superior
on the spot, because he knew them to be illegal, or prejudicial to the
interests of his country. The most remarkable of these is his conduct
in the West Indies, because he had then no established reputation
to support him. But Nelson was well aware that this is a course
which no officer can be justified in pursuing, except under the full and
clear conviction, not only that his own views are just, but that the
occasion is of sufficient importance to justify such a deviation from
the rules of service; and that, even when the transgression is justified
by the event, it yet involves a most serious degree of responsibility.
âWell,â he said, after the battle of Copenhagen, âI have fought
contrary to orders, and I shall perhaps be hanged. Never mind, let
them.â The feeling which prompted these words, though uttered half
in jest, can hardly be mistaken. Another of the most admirable qualities
of his character is the extraordinary power which he possessed of
attaching all who served under him. His sailors adored him; and
many touching anecdotes might be told of their affection. âOur
Nel,â they used to say, âis as brave as a lion, and as gentle as a
lamb.â To his officers he was equally kind and considerate. Happy
was the midshipman who in Nelsonâs younger days could obtain a berth
in his ship. He himself attended to their instruction, and was diligent
in so training them, as to become ornaments to the service by their
gentlemanly feeling and deportment, as well as by their professional
skill. Humane as brave, it was ever his object to avoid needless bloodshed:
and though the virulence of national enmity led him into the
most bitter expressions of hatred to the French, he was ever eager to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>rescue a drowning, or afford hospitality and protection to a beaten
enemy. âMay humanity after victory be the predominant feature in
the British fleet,â was part of the prayer which he composed on the
morning of Trafalgar. There is indeed one stain on his humanity, one
stain on his good faith;âthe deliverance of the Neapolitan revolutionists
to the vengeance of a cowardly and cruel court. Of this we
have already spoken; and far from excusing, we do not even wish to
palliate it. It was the result of his fatal attachment to Lady Hamilton:
and it is the duty of the biographer to point out that the one great blot
on his domestic, led to the one great blot upon his public character.
He has added another to the list of great men, who, proof against
other temptations, have yielded to female influence; and we may add
(for it is a valuable lesson) that in so doing he not only blemished his
fame, but ruined his happiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards his country, however, Nelson was faultless; and its gratitude
has been worthily shown by heaping honours on his memory.
His brother was made an earl, and an estate was purchased for the
family, and a pension granted to support the title. His remains were
brought to England, and interred with the utmost pomp of funeral
ceremony in the cemetery of St. Paulâs. His ship, the Victory, is
still preserved at Portsmouth, and will long continue to be a chief
object of interest to the visitors of that mighty arsenal.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CUVIER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>George Leopold Christian Frederic Dagobert Cuvier was
born August 23, 1769, at Montbeliard, a small town in Alsace, which
then formed part of the territory of the Duke of Wurtemburg. His
father was a retired officer, living upon his pension, who had formerly
held a commission in a Swiss regiment in the service of France. He
had the inestimable advantage of possessing a very sensible mother
who even in infancy attended with sedulous care to the formation of his
character, and the development of his mind. He gave early indications
that nature had endowed him with her choicest intellectual gifts. A
memory of extraordinary strength, joined to industry, and to the power
of fixing his attention steadily upon whatever he was engaged in,
enabled him to master all the ordinary studies of youth with facility;
and by the time he was fourteen years of age he had acquired a fair
knowledge of the ancient, and of several modern languages, and had
made considerable progress in the mathematics, besides having stored
his mind by a wide range of historical reading. He very early gave
proofs of a talent for drawing, which in after-life proved of material
service in his researches into natural history. When he was twelve
years old he read the works of Buffon with avidity, and he no doubt
received from the writings of that accomplished and elegant historian
of nature an early bias towards the study of zoology. While he was
at school he instituted a little academy of sciences among his companions,
of which he was elected the president: his sleeping-room
was their hall of meeting, and the bottom of his bed the presidentâs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>chair. They read extracts from books of history, travels, and natural
philosophy, which they discussed; and the debate was usually followed
by an opinion on the merits of the question, pronounced from
the chair.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In 1783 the reigning Duke of Wurtemburg visited Montbeliard;
and became acquainted with the unusual attainments of young Cuvier,
who had then reached the fourteenth year of his age. Struck by the
early promise of future eminence, he offered to take him under his own
protection. The proposal was readily accepted, and the future philosopher
went to Stutgard to prosecute his studies in the university of
that place. He continued there four years, and did not fail to turn
to good account the excellent opportunities which were afforded to
him, of laying the foundation of that extensive acquaintance with
every great department of human knowledge, for which he was in
after-life so eminently distinguished. The universality of his genius
was as remarkable as the depth and accuracy of his learning in that
particular field of science, with which his name is more especially
associated. He not only gained the highest academical prizes, but
was decorated by the Duke with an order; a distinction which was
only conferred upon five or six out of the four hundred students at
the university.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had now arrived at an age when it was necessary for him to
choose a profession, and his inclination led him to seek employment in
one of the public offices in the country of his patron. This he would
probably have obtained; but, happily for science, the circumstances of
his parents made it impossible for him to linger in expectation, and
he changed his views. In July, 1788, being then in his nineteenth
year, he accepted the office of tutor in a Protestant family in Normandy,
having been himself brought up in that faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>The family lived in a very retired situation near the sea; and
Cuvier was not so constantly engaged with his pupils as to prevent
him from cultivating those branches of science, for which he had
imbibed a decided taste while listening to the lectures of Abel, the
professor of natural history at Stutgard. He devoted himself especially
to the study of the Mollusca, for which his vicinity to the sea
afforded him good opportunities; and continued his researches uninterruptedly
for six years in this retirement. The reign of terror at
Paris, which spared neither virtue nor talent, drove M. Tessier, a
member of the Academy of Sciences, to seek refuge in Normandy.
He became acquainted with the young naturalist, and soon learned to
appreciate his talents; and he introduced him to the correspondence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>of several of the more eminent men of science in Paris, among
whom were Lametheric, Olivier, and LacepÃ¨de. The impression
which Cuvier made upon his correspondents was so great, that when
tranquillity was restored, they invited him to come to the capital. He
accepted the invitation, and in the spring of 1795 removed to Paris.
He was soon afterwards appointed Professor of Natural History in the
central school of the Pantheon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being very desirous of obtaining some official connexion with the
Museum of Natural History at the Jardin des Plantes, with the view
of gaining free access to the valuable collections there deposited, he
solicited the aid of his scientific friends, and by their exertions,
particularly those of De Jussieu, Geoffroy, and LacepÃ¨de, he was
nominated assistant to Mertrud, the professor of comparative anatomy,
a chair which had been recently instituted. Here he had free scope
to indulge his passion for that branch of science, and by his indefatigable
exertions he speedily brought together a very copious supply
of illustrations for his lectures. He never ceased to make the museum
a primary object of his care, and at last formed the most perfect and
the most splendid collection of comparative anatomy which exists in
the world. The excellence of his lectures, in which the interest of
the subject was heightened by his eloquence and easy delivery, attracted
a crowd of auditors; and while he thus excited and extended a taste for
a department of science previously but little cultivated, those who
listened to him spread the fame of the young professor.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the establishment of the Institute in 1796 he was chosen one of
the original members; and the papers which he read before that body,
giving an account of his researches and discoveries in comparative
anatomy, enriched their memoirs, and procured for him a high and
widely extended reputation at an early period of life. In 1800 he was
appointed Secretary to the Institute. In the same year Bonaparte was
appointed President. Cuvier thus, by virtue of his office, was brought
into immediate and frequent communication with that extraordinary
man; an event which had a material influence upon his future destiny,
and opened to him new and wide fields of usefulness and distinction.
Such were the powers of his mind, and so great was the versatility
of his genius, that in whatever situation he was placed his superiority
was soon acknowledged by his associates.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1802 the attention of the First Consul was directed to
the subject of public instruction, and six inspectors-general were commissioned
to organize lyceums or colleges in thirty towns of France.
Cuvier was one of them, and he left Paris to execute the duties which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>had been assigned to him in the provinces. From this period his
attention was always particularly directed to the subject of education;
and his labours in that cause have had the most important influence
upon every institution for public instruction in France, from the
University of Paris down to the most humble village school. At the
foundation of the Imperial University in 1808, Cuvier was named a
member of its council for life. When Italy was annexed to the
French empire, he was charged at three different times with missions
to that country, for the purpose of re-organizing the old academies
and colleges, and of establishing new ones: and in the last of those
missions in 1813, although a Protestant, he was sent to form the
University at Rome. In 1811 he went into Belgium and Holland to
perform the same duties; and the reports which he drew up on that
occasion, which were afterwards printed, possess great interest, especially
in those parts where he speaks of the schools in Holland for the
lower classes. He felt how important it is to the welfare of a nation,
that good education should be within reach even of the poor: and there
is no country in Europe where that subject is attended to with more
enlightened views than in Holland, where excellent primary schools
have been in operation for nearly half a century. When the great
measure for the general introduction of schools for the lower orders
throughout France, was brought forward in 1821, the duty of drawing
up the plan upon which they were to be established was confided to
Cuvier; and his enlightened benevolence and practical good sense are
equally conspicuous in the system which on his recommendation was
adopted. It has proved admirably adapted to the ends in view. The
direction of the Protestant schools was more particularly intrusted to
him, and he introduced into all those which had previously existed
many important improvements.</p>

<p class='c000'>In February, 1815, the university was remodelled by the Bourbon
government, and Cuvier was appointed a member of the Royal Council
of Public Instruction. Shortly afterwards came the events of the
Hundred Days, and among them the restoration of the Imperial
University. Cuvier was re-appointed to his seat in the Council, for
they felt that they could not do there without him. In four months
another revolution took place in the university, as in other public
establishments; and as it was found that the system of the Royal
University could not be resumed, a commission was appointed to execute
the functions of the Grand Master, the Chancellor, and the Treasurer.
In this commission the duties which had belonged to the
Chancellor were assigned to Cuvier. In this station he was eminently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>useful in maintaining the rights of the university under circumstances
of no ordinary difficulty. He was twice President of the Commission,
and each time for a year; but on account of his being a Protestant
he could not retain that place permanently. But the Bishop, who,
as a member of the commission, had discharged the duties which
belonged to the Grand Master of the University, was appointed
minister for ecclesiastical affairs; and Cuvier was nominated as his
successor, so far as concerned the Protestant faculty of theology, and
continued to act in this capacity for the rest of his life. As a member
of the Council of State, and attached to the department of the
Minister of the Interior, he had the direction of all matters relating
to Protestant, and other religious congregations, not Catholic.</p>

<p class='c000'>During his mission to Rome in 1813 he was appointed by Napoleon
a member of the Council of State; and on the restoration of the
Bourbons his political opinions formed no obstacle to his continuing
in that place. Although he was left undisturbed in his situation at
the university, he was removed from the Council of State during the
Hundred Days; but resumed his seat when the fate of his former
patron and master was sealed. It is to be regretted that a mind so
powerful as that of Cuvier should not have felt the paramount importance
of having settled opinions on the great principles of government;
and the facility with which he made himself acceptable to the
despotic Emperor, the weak and bigoted Bourbons, and the liberal
government of Louis Philippe, showed a want of fixed public principle
which casts a shade upon the memory of this great man.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a member of the Council of State he took a distinguished lead,
which indeed he never failed to do wherever he was placed, and he
was eminently useful by his extraordinary talent for the despatch of
business. He was a patient listener, and was never forward with
his opinion; he allowed the useless talkers to have their course, and,
while he appeared indifferent to what was going on, he was often
drawing up a resolution, which his colleagues usually adopted without
farther discussion, after he had given a short and luminous exposition
of his views. For thirteen years previous to his death he was
chairman of the Committee of the Council of State, to which the
affairs of the interior belong; and the quantity of business which
passed through his hands was wonderful. It was accomplished by
his great skill in making those useful with whom he acted; by his
talent in keeping his colleagues to the point in their discussions; and
by his prodigious readiness of memory, which enabled him to go back
at once to former decisions where the principle of the question under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>deliberation had been already settled. His reading in history had
been very extensive, and his attention was ever alive to what was
passing around him, as well in other countries as in France; so
that he brought to bear on the matter in debate, not speculative
opinions merely, but maxims drawn from the experience of past
and present times. In the Chamber of Deputies, of which he was
a member for several years, he took an active part, and often
originated measures. His manner as a speaker was very impressive,
and the rich stores of his mind, and his ready and natural eloquence
commanded attention. At the end of 1831 he was created a peer;
and during the short time he sat in the Upper Chamber, he took
a prominent part in its business, and drew up some important reports
of committees to which he belonged.</p>

<p class='c000'>But his reputation as a statesman was confined to France: his
achievements in science have spread his fame over the civilized world.
We can in this place do little more than mention the titles of the
most important of Cuvierâs works; even to name all would carry
us beyond our limits. His earliest production was a memoir read
before the Natural History Society of Paris, in 1795, and published
in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">DÃ©cade Philosophique</span>. In this paper he objects to
the divisions of certain of the lower animals adopted by LinnÃ¦us, and
proposes a more scientific classification of the mollusca, crustacea,
worms, insects, and other invertebrate animals. His attention had
been long directed to that branch of natural history, and his subsequent
researches in the same department, most of which have been
communicated to the world through the medium of the âAnnales
du Museum,â have thrown great light on that obscure and curious
part of the creation. Three years afterwards, he published his
Elementary View of the Natural History of Animals, which contains
an outline of the lectures he delivered at the Pantheon. In this work
he displayed the vast extent of his acquaintance with the works of his
predecessors, and, at the same time, the originality of his own mind,
by introducing a new arrangement of the animal kingdom, founded
on more exact investigation and comparison of the varieties which
exist in anatomical structure. With the assistance of his friends,
Dumeril and Duvernay, he published, in 1802, his â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">LeÃ§ons dâAnatomie
ComparÃ©e</span>,â in two volumes, octavo, afterwards extended to five.
These are singularly lucid and exact, and form the most complete
work on the subject which has yet appeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next important publication we have to notice, is one in which
he embodied the results of his extensive researches in a very interesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>field of inquiry, concerning the remains of extinct species of
animals which are found enveloped in solid rocks, or buried in the
beds of gravel that cover the surface of the earth. We are disposed
to think his âRecherches sur les Ossemens Fossilesâ the most important
of his works, the most illustrious and imperishable monument
of his fame. The quarries in the neighbourhood of Paris abound
in fossil bones; and he had great facilities for collecting the valuable
specimens which were almost daily discovered in the ordinary
working of the quarry. When he went to Italy, he had an opportunity
of seeing animal remains of the same sort procured by the
naturalists of that country from their native soil, and preserved in
their museums. His attention became now specially attracted to the
subject; and having accumulated materials from all parts of the world,
he announced the important truths at which he had arrived in the
work above-mentioned, in four quarto volumes, in the year 1812. A
new edition, enlarged to five volumes, appeared in 1817, and in 1824
it was extended to seven volumes, illustrated by two hundred engravings.
No one who was not profoundly skilled in comparative anatomy
could have entered upon the inquiry with any prospect of success;
and Cuvier not only possessed that qualification, but was singularly
constituted by nature for the task. His powerful memory was particularly
susceptible of retaining impressions conveyed to it by the eye:
he saw at a glance the most minute variations of form, and what he
saw he not only never forgot, but he had the power of representing
upon paper with the utmost accuracy and despatch. It is very
seldom that the entire skeleton of an animal is found in a fossil
state: in most instances the bones have been separated and scattered
before they were entombed, and a tusk, a jaw, or a single joint of the
back-bone is very often all that is met with, and frequently too in a
mutilated state. But an instructed mind like that of Cuvier was able
to re-construct the whole animal from the inspection of one fragment.
He had discovered by his previous researches such a connexion
between the several bones, that a particular curvature, or a small
protuberance on a jaw, or a tooth, was sufficient to indicate a particular
species of animal, and to prove that the fragment could not have
belonged to any other. The âRecherches sur les Ossemens Fossilesâ
have made us acquainted with more than seventy species of animals
before unknown.</p>

<p class='c000'>The preliminary discourse in the first volume is a masterly exposition
of the revolutions which the crust of the earth has undergone:
revolutions to which the animal creation has been equally subject. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>is written with great clearness and elegance, and is so much calculated
to interest general readers as well as men of science, that it has been
translated into most of the European languages. The English translation,
by Professor Jameson, published under the title of âEssay on the
Theory of the Earth,â has gone through several editions.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his examination of the fossil bones found near Paris, Cuvier was
led to inquire into the geological structure of the country around that
capital. He assumed M. Alexander Bronguiart as his associate, and
the result of their joint labours is contained in one of the volumes of
the work now under consideration, in an Essay on the Mineralogy of
the Environs of Paris. This essay formed a great epoch in geological
science, for it was then that the grand division of the tertiary formations
was first shown to form a distinct class. A new direction and a
fresh impulse was thus given to geological investigations; and many
of the most important general truths at which we have now arrived
in this science, have been established by discoveries to which the
essay of Cuvier and Bronguiart led the way.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1817 appeared the first edition of the â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">RÃ¨gne Animal</span>,â in four
octavo volumes, one of which was written by the celebrated naturalist
Latreille. This work gives an account of the structure and history
of all existing and extinct races of animals: it has subsequently been
enlarged. Cuvier began, in conjunction with M. Valenciennes,
an extensive general work on fishes, which it was calculated
would extend to twenty volumes. Eight only have appeared;
for the embarrassments among the Parisian booksellers, in 1830,
suspended the publication, and it has thus been left incomplete;
but a great mass of materials was collected, and we may hope
that they will yet be published. In addition to these great undertakings,
he had been for years collecting materials for a stupendous
work, a complete system of comparative anatomy, to be illustrated
by drawings from nature, and chiefly from objects in the
Museum at the Jardin des Plantes. Above a thousand drawings,
many executed by his own hand, are said to have been made. Looking
back to what he had already accomplished, and considering his
health and age, for he was only in his sixty-third year, it was not
unreasonable in him to hope to see the great edifice erected, of which
he had laid the foundation and collected the materials. But unfortunately
for the cause of science it was ordered otherwise, and there is
something particularly touching in the last words he uttered to his
friend the Baron Pasquier, and in sounds, too, scarcely articulate, from
the malady which so suddenly cut short his careerââ<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous le voyez, il
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>y a loin de lâhomme du Mardi (nous nous Ã©tions rencontrÃ©s ce jour lÃ )
Ã  lâhomme du Dimanche: et tant de choses, cependant, qui me restaient
Ã  faire! trois ouvrages importans Ã  mettre au jour, les matÃ©riaux prÃ©parÃ©s,
tout Ã©tait disposÃ© dans ma tÃªte, il ne me restait plus quâÃ  Ã©crire.</span></i>â
âYou see how it is, how different the man of Tuesday (we had met
on that day) from the man of Sunday: and so many things too
that remained for me to do! three important works to bring out, the
materials prepared, all disposed in order in my head, I had nothing
left to do but to write.â In four hours afterwards that wonderfully
organized head had become a mere mass of insensible matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the works above enumerated, and many memoirs in the
transactions of the scientific bodies of Paris, he has given to the world,
in four octavo volumes, a History of the Progress of the Physical
Sciences, from 1789 to 1827, which evince his genius and extensive
erudition. The first volume is a reprint of a report which he
presented, as Perpetual Secretary of the Institute, to Napoleon, in
1808, on the Progress of the Physical Sciences from 1789 to 1807.
In the same capacity, during thirty-two years, he pronounced the
customary Eloges upon deceased members of the Institute. These
are collected in three octavo volumes, and bear witness to the versatility
of his genius and the extent of his attainments; for whether he is
recording the merits of a mathematician, a chemist, a botanist, a
geologist, or the cultivator of any other department of science, he
shows himself equally conversant with his subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>He lived at the Jardin des Plantes for nearly forty years, surrounded
by the objects which engrossed so great a portion of his
thoughts, and there received every Saturday the men of science of
Paris, and all others who visited that capital from any part of the
world. Professors and pupils met in his rooms to listen with instruction
and delight to his conversation, for he was accessible to all.
Although compelled to be a very rigid economist of his time, he was
so goodnatured and considerate, that if any person who had business
to transact with him called at an unexpected hour, he never sent
him away; saying, that one who lived so far off had no right to deny
himself. Every thing in his house was so arranged as to secure
economy of time: his library consisted of several apartments, and each
great subject he attended to had a separate room allotted to it; and he
usually worked in the apartment belonging to the subject he was
at the moment engaged with, so that he might be surrounded with
his materials. His ordinary custom, when he returned from attending
public business in Paris, was to go at once to his study, passing a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>minutes by the way in the room where his family sat; which latterly
consisted of Madame Cuvier and her daughter by a former marriage.
He came back when dinner was announced, usually with a
book in his hand; and returned soon after dinner to his study, where
he remained till eleven. He then came to Madame Cuvierâs room,
and had generally some of the lighter literature of the day read
aloud to him. Sometimes the book selected was of a graver cast,
for it is said that during the last year of his life he had the greater
part of Cicero read to him. His manner was courteous, kind, and
encouraging: every one who took an interest in any subject with
which Cuvier was familiar, felt assured that he might approach him
without fear of meeting with a cold or discouraging reception.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had four children, but lost them all. The last taken from him
was a daughter, who was suddenly carried off by consumption on the
eve of her marriage. He was most tenderly attached to her, and it
required all the efforts of his powerful mind to prevent his sinking
under the blow. He found distraction by intense thought on other
subjects, but not consolation, for the wound never healed.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Tuesday, the 8th of May, 1832, he opened his usual course
at the College of France, with a particularly eloquent introductory
lecture, full of enthusiasm in his subject, to the delight of his numerous
audience. As he left the room he was attacked with the first
symptoms of the disease which was so soon to prove fatal: it was a
paralytic seizure. He was well enough, however, to preside the next
day at the Committee of the Council of State, but that was the last
duty he performed. He died on the following Sunday, leaving
behind him an imperishable name, which will be held in honour in
the most advanced state of human learning.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>RAY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>John Ray, whom Haller describes as the greatest botanist in the
memory of man, and whose writings on animals are pronounced by
Cuvier to be the foundation of all modern zoology, was born on the
29th of November, 1628, at Black Notley, near Braintree, in Essex.
His father was a blacksmith, who availed himself of the advantages of
a free grammar school at Black Notley to bestow upon his son a liberal
education. John was designed for holy orders; and was accordingly
entered at Catherine Hall, Cambridge, in his sixteenth year. He
subsequently removed to Trinity, of which college he was elected a
Fellow, in the same year with the celebrated Isaac Barrow. In 1651
he was appointed Greek Lecturer of his college; and afterwards Mathematical
Lecturer and Humanity Reader.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the midst of his professional occupations Ray appears to have
devoted himself to that course of observation of the works of nature,
which was afterwards to constitute the business and pleasure of his
life, and upon which his enduring reputation was to be built. In
1660 he published his â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catalogus Plantarum circa Cantabrigiam
nascentium</span>,â which work he states to be the result of ten years of
research. He must, therefore, have become a naturalist in the best
sense of the wordâhe must have observed as well as readâat the
period when he was struggling for university honours, and obtaining
them in company with some of the most eminent persons of his own
day. Before the publication of his catalogue, he had visited many
parts of England and Wales, for the purpose chiefly of collecting
their native plants; and his Itineraries, which were first published in
1760, under the title off âSelect Remains of the learned John Ray,â show
that he was a careful and diligent observer of every matter that could
enlarge his understanding and correct his taste. His principal companion
in his favourite studies was his friend and pupil, Francis Willughby.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>In December, 1660, Ray was ordained Deacon and Priest at the
same time. But the chances of preferment in the church of England,
which his admirable talents and learning, as well as the purity of his
life and the genuine warmth of his piety, would probably have won
for him, were at once destroyed by his honest and inflexible resolution
not to subscribe to the conditions required by the Act of Uniformity of
1662, by which divines were called upon to swear that the oath
entitled the Solemn League and Covenant was not binding upon
those who had taken it. Ray was in consequence deprived of his
fellowship. The affection of his pupil, Willughby, relieved him from
the embarrassment which might have been a consequence of this
misfortune. The two friends from this time appear to have dedicated
themselves almost wholly to the study of natural history. They travelled
upon the Continent for three years, from 1663 to 1666; and
during the remainder of Willughbyâs life, which unfortunately was
terminated in 1672, their time was principally occupied in observations
which had for their object to examine and to register the various productions
of nature, upon some method which should obviate the difficulty
of those arbitrary and fanciful classifications which had prevailed
up to their day. In the preface to his first botanical attempt, the
Catalogue of Cambridge Plants, Ray describes the obstacles which he
found in the execution of such a work;âhe had no guide to consult,
and he had to form a method of arrangement, solely by his own
sagacity and patience. At that period, as he says in his âWisdom of God
in the Creation,â âdifferent colour, or multiplicity of leaves in the flower,
and the like accidents, were sufficient to constitute a specific difference.â
From a conversation with Ray a short time before his death, Derham
has described the object which the two friends had in their agreeable
but laborious pursuits. âThese two gentlemen, finding the history of
nature very imperfect, had agreed between themselves, before their
travels beyond sea, to reduce the several tribes of things to a method;
and to give accurate descriptions of the several species, from a strict
view of them.â That Ray entered upon his task, however perplexing
it might be, with the enthusiastic energy of a man really in love with his
subject, we cannot doubt. âWillughby,â says Derham, âprosecuted his
design with as great application as if he had been to get his bread
thereby.â The good sense of Ray saw distinctly the right path in
such an undertaking. There is a passage in his âWisdom of God,â
which beautifully exhibits his own conception of the proper character
of a naturalist: âLet it not suffice us to be book-learned, to read what
others have written, and to take upon trust more falsehood than truth.
But let us ourselves examine things as we have opportunity, and converse
with nature as well as books. Let us endeavour to promote and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>increase this knowledge, and make new discoveries; not so much distrusting
our own parts or despairing of our own abilities, as to think
that our industry can add nothing to the invention of our ancestors, or
correct any of their mistakes. Let us not think that the bounds
of science are fixed like Herculesâ pillars, and inscribed with a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne
plus ultra</span></i>. Let us not think we have done when we have learnt
what they have delivered to us. The treasures of nature are inexhaustible.
Here is employment enough for the vastest parts, the most
indefatigable industries, the happiest opportunities, the most prolix and
undisturbed vacancies.â It is not difficult to imagine the two friends
encouraging each other in their laborious career by sentiments such as
these; which are as worthy to be held in remembrance now that we
are reaping the full advantage of their labours, and those of their
many illustrious successors, as in the days when natural history was,
for the most part, a tissue of extravagant fables and puerile conceits.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1667 Ray was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society; and he
executed, about that time, a translation into Latin of his friend Bishop
Wilkinsâ work, on a philosophical and universal language. In 1670
he published the first edition of his âCatalogue of English Plants;â
and in 1672 appeared his âCollection of English Proverbs;â which
he probably took up as a relaxation from his more systematic
pursuits. In this year he suffered the irreparable loss of his friend
Willughby. The history of letters presents us with few more striking
examples of the advantages to the world, as well as to the individuals
themselves, of such a cordial union for a great object. The affection
of Ray for Willughby was of the noblest kind. He became the
guardian and tutor of his children; and he prepared his posthumous
works for publication, with additions from his own pen, for which he
claimed no credit, with a diligence and accuracy which showed that he
considered the reputation of his friend as the most sacred of all trusts.
In 1673, being in his forty-fifth year, Ray married. Willughby had
left him an annuity of Â£60. He had three daughters. During the
remainder of his long life, which reached to his 77th year, he resided
in or near his native village, living contentedly, as a layman, upon
very humble means, but indefatigably contributing to the advancement
of natural history, and directing the study of it to the highest end,âthe
proof of the wisdom and goodness of the great Author of Nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most celebrated of Rayâs botanical publications is his â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Synopsis
Methodica Stirpium Britannicarum</span>.â Sir James Smith, in a memoir
of Ray, in Reesâs EncyclopÃ¦dia, declares that of all the systematical and
practical Floras of any country, the second edition of Rayâs Synopsis is
the most perfect. The same writer, in the Transactions of the LinnÃ¦an
Society, vol. iv., says of this Synopsis, âhe examined every plant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>recorded in his work, and even gathered most of them himself. He
investigated their synonyms with consummate accuracy; and if the
clearness and precision of other authors had equalled his, he would
scarcely have committed an error.â Rayâs â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Methodus Plantarum Nova</span>,â
first published in 1682, has been superseded by other systems; but
the accuracy of his observations, the precision of his language, and the
clearness of his general views, tended greatly to the advancement of
botanical science. His âHistoria Plantarum,â in three vols. folio, a
vast compilation, including all the botanical knowledge of his day, is
still in use, as a book of reference, by those who especially devote
themselves to this study.</p>

<p class='c000'>The zoological works of Ray have had a more direct and permanent
influence upon the advancement of natural history, than his botanical.
Amongst his zoological productions, the best authorities are agreed
that we ought to include the greater part of those edited by him as the
posthumous works of his friend Willughby. They are conceived upon
the same principle as his own History of Plants, and are arranged upon
a nearly similar plan; whilst the style of each is undoubtedly the same.
In the original division of their great subject, Ray had chosen the
vegetable kingdom, and Willughby the animal; and Ray, therefore,
may have felt himself compelled to forego some of his own proper
claims, that he might raise a complete monument to the memory of his
friend. The Ornithology appeared in 1676; the History of Fishes in
1686. Ray, however, prepared several very important zoological works,
of his entire claims to which there can be no doubt. The chief of
these are, â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Synopsis methodica animalium quadrupedum et serpentini
generis</span>,â 1693, which he published during his life; â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Synopsis methodica
avium</span>,â and â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Synopsis methodica piscium</span>,â edited by Derham,
and published in 1713; and â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia insectorum</span>,â printed at the
expense of the Royal Society, in 1710. âThe peculiar character of the
zoological works of Ray,â says Cuvier, âconsists in clearer and more
rigorous methods than those of any of his predecessors, and applied
with more constancy and precision.â The divisions which he has introduced
into the classes of quadrupeds and birds have been followed by
the English naturalists, almost to our own day; and one finds very evident
traces of his system of birds in LinnÃ¦us, in Brisson, in Buffon,
and in all the authors who are occupied with this class of animals. The
Ornithology of Salerne is little more than a translation from the
Synopsis; and Buffon has extracted from Willughby almost all the
anatomical part of his History of Birds. Daubenton and Hauy have
translated the History of Fishes, in great part, for their Dictionary of
Ichthyology, in the â<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">EncyclopÃ©die Methodique</span>.â</p>

<p class='c000'>âThe Wisdom of God in the Creationâ is the work upon which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>popular fame of Ray most deservedly rests. It is a book which perhaps
more than any other in our language unites the precision of science to
the warmth of devotion. It is delightful to see the ardour with which
this good man dedicated himself to the observation of nature entering
into his views of another state of existence, when our knowledge shall
be made perfect, and the dim light with which we grope amidst the
beautiful and wondrous objects by which we are surrounded, shall
brighten into complete day. âIt is not likely,â says he, âthat eternal
life shall be a torpid and inactive state, or that it shall consist only in
an uninterrupted and endless act of love; the other faculties shall be
employed as well as the will, in actions suitable to, and perfective of
their natures: especially the understanding, the supreme faculty of the
soul, which chiefly differs in us from brute beasts, and makes us
capable of virtue and vice, of rewards and punishments, shall be busied
and employed in contemplating the works of God, and observing the
divine art and wisdom manifested in the structure and composition of
them; and reflecting upon their Great Architect the praise and glory
due to him. Then shall we clearly see, to our great satisfaction and
admiration, the ends and uses of those things, which here were either
too subtle for us to penetrate and discover, or too remote and unaccessible
for us to come to any distinct view of, viz. the planets and fixed stars;
those illustrious bodies, whose contents and inhabitants, whose stores
and furniture we have here so longing a desire to know, as also their
mutual subserviency to each other. Now the mind of man being not
capable at once to advert to more than one thing, a particular view and
examination of such an innumerable number of vast bodies, and the
great multitude of species, both of animate and inanimate beings, which
each of them contains, will afford matter enough to exercise and employ
our minds, I do not say to all eternity, but to many ages, should we
do nothing else<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a>.â</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In addition to his âWisdom of God,â Ray published three âPhysico-Theological
Discourses, concerning the Chaos, Deluge, and Dissolution
of the World.â âThis last presents to us,â to use the words of Cuvier,
âa system of geology as plausible as any of those which had appeared
at this epoch, or for a long time afterwards.â He also printed a work
expressly of a theological character, âA Persuasive to a Holy Life.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Ray died on the 17th January, 1705, at his native place of Black

expressed, âfor the short pittance of time he had yet to live in this
world.â His memory has been done justice to by his countrymen.
A most interesting commemoration of him was held in London, on the
29th Nov., 1828, being the two hundredth anniversary of his birth.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>COOK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>James Cook was born October 27, 1728, at Marton, a village in the
North Riding of Yorkshire, near Stockton-upon-Tees. His parents,
who were farm-servants, of good esteem in their rank of life, apprenticed
him when not thirteen years of age to a haberdasher at the fishing
town of Staith, near Whitby. The employment proved ill suited to
his taste; and he soon quitted it, and bound himself to a ship-owner at
Whitby. In course of time he became mate of one of his masterâs
vessels in the coal trade; that best of schools for practical seamanship.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the spring of 1755 he was lying in the Thames, when war was
declared between England and France, and a hot press for seamen
ensued. He volunteered to serve on board the Eagle frigate, commanded
by Captain, afterwards Sir Hugh Palliser, and soon won the
esteem of his officers by his diligence and activity. In May, 1759, he
was promoted to be master of the Mercury, in which he was present
at the celebrated siege of Quebec. At the recommendation of Captain
Palliser, he was employed to take soundings of the river St. Lawrence,
opposite to, and preparatory to an attack on the French fortified camp;
and in this hazardous service he manifested so much sagacity and resolution,
that he was afterwards ordered to survey the river below Quebec.
The accurate chart, which was published as the result of his labours,
furnishes a most satisfactory proof of Cookeâs natural talents and steady
industry; for he could have derived little aid in such pursuits from
the habits of his early life. In the autumn he was removed into the
Northumberland man-of-war, stationed at Halifax, in Nova Scotia;
and he employed his leisure during the long winter in making up for
the defects of his education, which had been merely such as a village
school could supply. He now read Euclid for the first time, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>applied himself to study those branches of science, which promised
to be most useful in his profession. Towards the end of 1762 he
returned to England, and married; but in 1763 he again went out to
make a survey of Newfoundland. In 1764, his steady friend, Sir
Hugh Palliser, being appointed Governor of Newfoundland, Cook was
made Marine Surveyor of Newfoundland and Labrador. He held this
office nearly four years, and his charts of those coasts remain in use up
to this day.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1767 Government determined, at the request of the Royal
Society, to send out astronomers to the South Pacific Ocean to observe
the transit of Venus across the sunâs disc. Cookâs able discharge of
his duties at Newfoundland, and the skill with which he observed an
eclipse of the sun there, pointed him out to Mr. Stephens, Secretary to
the Admiralty, as a proper person to conduct the expedition: and
at that gentlemanâs recommendation, backed by Sir Hugh Palliser,
he was selected for this purpose, and raised to the rank of Lieutenant.
He sailed from Plymouth, August 23, 1768, in the Endeavour, of
three hundred and seventy tons, accompanied by Mr. Green as astronomer,
and by Mr. Banks. Passing round Cape Horn, they anchored,
April 11, 1769, at Otaheite, or Tahiti, as it is named by the latest
visitors, which had been discovered by Captain Wallis, and was now
selected as a proper place to observe the transit. As it was necessary
to remain some time on the island, and highly expedient to be on
good terms with the natives, Lieutenant Cook used much precaution
to place the traffic between them and the strangers on an equitable
footing; and to prevent the wanton injuries which the sense of
superior power, and an unjust contempt, too often induce Europeans
to inflict upon the rude inhabitants of newly-discovered regions. And
we may here mention, as one of the good points of Cookâs character,
that he always showed a scrupulous regard to the rights of property,
taking no articles from the natives except on fair terms of gift or
barter; and that he had a tender regard for human life, not only
avoiding to use our deadly weapons, as discoverers have too often
done, in revenge for petty depredations, harmless insults, and contemptible
attacks, but even restraining a natural curiosity, where the
indulgence of it seemed likely to shock prejudices, or to lead to
collision and bloodshed. The inhabitants of Otaheite are a gentle
race, and no serious misunderstandings occurred between them and
their visitors. The transit was satisfactorily observed June 3; and,
July 13, the Endeavour resumed her voyage, pursuant to Cookâs
instructions, which were to prosecute his discoveries in the Southern
Ocean, after the astronomical purposes of the expedition had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>fulfilled. He cruised a month among the then unknown group of
the Society Islands, and afterwards proceeded in search of the Terra
Australis, the great southern continent, so long supposed by geographers
to exist, as a necessary counterpoise to the extensive continents of
the northern hemisphere. Land was seen October 6, displaying lofty
ranges of mountains; and it was generally supposed that the long
wished for discovery was made. It proved, however, to be New Zealand,
unvisited by Europeans since Tasman first approached its shores,
in 1642. Cook spent six months in circumnavigating this country, and
ascertained that it consisted of two large islands. March 31, 1770, he
commenced his voyage home. He directed his course along the eastern
coast of New Holland, then quite unknown; laid down a chart of it
through nearly its whole extent; and took every opportunity to increase
our stock of knowledge in natural history, as well as geographical
science. For more than 1300 miles he had safely navigated this most
dangerous shore, where the sharp coral reefs rise like a wall to the
surface of the water, when, on the night of June 10, the ship suddenly
struck. She was found to be aground on a coral reef, which rose
around her to within a few feet of the surface. Though lightened
immediately by every possible means, two tides elapsed before she
could be got off; and then with so much injury to her bottom, that
she could only be kept afloat by working three pumps night and day.
When the men were all but worn out by this labour, a midshipman
suggested the expedient of <em>fothering</em> the ship, or passing a sail charged
with oakum, and other loose materials, under her keel: which succeeded
so well, that the leak was then kept under by a single pump;
and the navigators proceeded in comparative security till the 14th,
when a harbour was discovered, afterwards named Endeavour River,
suitable for making the necessary repairs. It was then found that a
large fragment of coral rock had stuck in the shipâs bottom, so as in
great measure to close the leak, which must otherwise have admitted
a body of water sufficient to set the pumps at defiance. To this providential
occurrence they owed their safety; for, had the ship foundered,
the boats could not have contained the whole crew. Among many
dangers, Cook pursued his course through that intricate tract of reefs
and islands, which he named the Labyrinth, to the northern point of
New Holland: and having now explored the whole eastern coast, from
lat. 38Â° to 10Â° 30Â´, he took possession of it by the name of New South
Wales. He then made sail for New Guinea, having proved that New
Guinea and New Holland are separate islands, and from thence proceeded
to Batavia, which he reached October 9. Here they obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>refreshments and repaired the ship, which was found to be in a most
perilous state: but these advantages were dearly bought by a sojourn in
that pestilential place. Seven persons died at Batavia, and twenty-three
more during the voyage to the Cape. June 12, 1771, the Endeavour
dropped anchor in the Downs, and terminated her long and adventurous
voyage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The manner in which Lieutenant Cook had performed his task gave
perfect satisfaction, and he was promoted to the rank of Commander.
The public curiosity was strongly roused to know the particulars of
his adventures; and it was gratified by an account of the several expeditions
to the Southern Ocean, commanded by Byron, Wallis, and
Cook, composed by Dr. Hawkesworth from the original materials, and
illustrated by charts and plates, engraved at the expense of Government.
Cook communicated to the Royal Society an âAccount of the
flowing of the Tides in the South Sea,â published in their Transactions,
vol. lxii. His voyage had proved two things: first, that neither New
Zealand or New Holland were parts of the great southern continent,
supposing it to exist; secondly, that no such continent could exist to
the northward of 40Â° S. lat. He had not, however, ascertained its
non-existence in higher latitudes, nor did it enter into his commission
to do so. Now, however, it was resolved to send out a second expedition,
to ascertain this point, under the command of him who had so
ably conducted the former one. Two ships were fitted out with
every thing conducive to the health and comfort of the voyagers: the
Resolution, of four hundred and sixty tons, and a smaller vessel, the
Adventure, Captain Furneaux; which, however, was separated from
her consort early in the second year of the voyage. They sailed from
Plymouth, July 13, 1772. Captain Cookâs instructions were, to circumnavigate
the globe in high southern latitudes, prosecuting his
discoveries as near to the South Pole as possible, using every exertion
to fall in with the supposed continent, or any islands which might
exist in those unknown seas; and endeavouring, by all proper means,
to cultivate a friendship and alliance with the inhabitants. The expedition
left the Cape of Good Hope Nov. 22, and cruised, for near four
months, between the Cape and New Zealand, from E. long. 20Â° to
170Â°, their extreme point to the southward being lat. 67Â° 15Â´. Having
satisfied himself that no land of great extent could exist between
these longitudes, to the northward of 60Â° S. lat., Cook made sail for
New Zealand, to refresh his crew, and reached it March 26, 1773.
The winter months, corresponding to our midsummer, he spent at
the Society Islands; and returning to New Zealand, he again sailed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>November 26, in quest of a southern continent, inclining his course to
the east. He first fell in with ice in lat. 62Â° 10Â´, W. long. 172Â°, and
continued to steer S.E. to lat. 67Â° 31Â´, W. long. 142Â° 54Â´, when, finding
it impossible at that time to get farther south, he returned northwards,
as far as lat. 50Â°, that he might be certain that no extensive country
had been left in that direction. January 6, 1774, he again shaped
his course southward, and on the 30th reached his extreme point of
southing, lat. 71Â° 10Â´, W. long. 106Â° 54Â´. Here he was stopped by ice,
which it was the general opinion might extend to the Pole, or join
some land to which it had been fixed from the earliest time. Returning
northwards, during the winter months he traversed nearly the whole
extent of the Pacific Ocean between the tropics, visiting Easter
Island, the Marquesas, the Society and Friendly Islands, the New
Hebrides, and another island, the largest yet discovered in the Pacific,
except those of New Zealand, which he called New Caledonia. He
then returned to New Zealand, and having passed three weeks in
friendly intercourse with the natives, took his departure, November 10.
Having cruised in various latitudes between 43Â° and 56Â°, a portion of
the ocean which he had not yet explored, and being in W. long.
138Â° 56Â´, he determined to steer direct for the western entrance of
the Straits of Magellan, and thence, along Tierra del Fuego, to the
Straits of Le Maire. December 29 he passed Cape Horn, and
re-entered the Atlantic Ocean, and standing southward, discovered
Sandwich Land, a desolate coast, the extreme point of which he named
the Southern Thule, lat. 59Â° 13Â´, as the most southern land that had
then been discovered. Later navigators have found land nearer to the
Pole. âI concluded,â Captain Cook observes, âthat Sandwich Land
was either a group of islands, or else a point of the continent, for I
firmly believe that there is a tract of land near the Pole, which is the
source of most of the ice which is spread over this vast southern ocean.
I also think it probable that it extends farthest to the north, opposite
the Southern Atlantic and Indian Oceans, because ice was always
found by us farther to the north in these oceans than any where else.â
Having now encompassed the globe in a high latitude, and thinking it
impossible to prosecute further researches in those tempestuous seas
with a worn-out ship, and nearly exhausted provisions, Cook made sail
for the Cape; and arrived there March 22, 1774, having sailed 20,000
leagues since he had left it, without so much injury to the ship as
springing a mast or yard. July 30 he anchored at Spithead.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was received in England with high applause, posted, and made a
Captain of Greenwich Hospital. On this occasion he published his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>own Journal, illustrated by maps and engravings; and the composition,
unpretending, but clear and manly, does honour to one whose
education had been so rude. Being elected Fellow of the Royal
Society, he contributed two papers to their Transactions, published in
vol. lxvi., one relating to the tides in the South Seas, the other containing
an account of the methods which he had taken to preserve the health
of his shipâs crew. The ravages of scurvy are now so much checked,
that few know from experience how dreadfully earlier navigators suffered
from that disease. It is one of Cookâs peculiar merits, that he
attended to the health of his seamen with such eminent success, that
during this long and painful voyage, not one man died of scurvy.
Four only died, out of a hundred and twelve persons on board the
Resolution, and of these but one was carried off by disease. That this
was, in a great degree, the merit of the Captain, is proved by the
Adventure having suffered much more, though fitted out exactly in
the same way. Sailors usually dislike changes in their mode of life;
and it required judgment and perseverance to induce them to adopt a
healthy regimen. Cook, however, succeeded in reconciling them to his
innovations; of the utility of which they were perfectly convinced, long
before the end of the voyage. The means which he used will be found
fully detailed in his paper, which was honoured by the Society with
the gold medal: those on which he chiefly relied were a large supply
of antiscorbutic stores, as malt, sour krout, and portable broth; the
enforcement of a vegetable diet, whenever vegetables could be procured;
and great care not to expose the crew unnecessarily to the weather,
and to keep their persons, their clothes, and their berths, clean, dry,
and well aired. Cook was justly proud of his success in this respect, and
he closed the account of his second voyage with words which show the
humanity and modesty of his temper. âWhatever may be the public
judgment about other matters, it is with real satisfaction, and without
claiming any other merit but that of attention to my duty, that I can
conclude this account with an observation, which facts enable me to
make, that our having discovered the possibility of preserving health
among a numerous shipâs company for such a length of time, in such
varieties of climate, and amid such continued hardships and fatigues,
will make this voyage remarkable, in the opinion of every benevolent
person, when the disputes about the southern continent shall have
ceased to engage the attention and to divide the judgment of philosophers.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Another geographical question, of still greater interest, engaged the
attention of the nation at this time; the practicability of a north-east
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>passage to China and the Indies. During Cookâs absence, one expedition
had been sent out, under Captain Phipps; it was now determined
to send out a second, reversing the usual order, and trying
to find a passage from the Pacific into the Atlantic Ocean. Cook
volunteered to quit his well-earned repose, and take the direction of
this enterprise; and the offer was gladly accepted. He was directed to
proceed, by the Cape of Good Hope, to New Zealand, thence through
the chain of islands scattered along the tropics, which he had already
visited. This done, he was to proceed northward, with all dispatch, to
the latitude of 65Â°, and to direct his attention to the discovery of a
passage into the Atlantic; and by the extension of an existing Act of
Parliament, the shipâs company, if successful, were entitled to a reward
of Â£20,000. With a most praiseworthy benevolence, the ships were
charged with cattle, sheep, and other useful animals, to be left, and
naturalized, if possible, in New Zealand, Otaheite, and other islands.
The Resolution and Discovery were fitted out for the voyage, with
every attention to the health and comfort of their crews. They sailed
from Plymouth July 12, 1776, and touching at New Zealand, reached
the Friendly Islands so late in the spring of 1777, that Captain Cook
thought it impossible to visit the Polar Seas to any purpose that year.
He therefore spent the whole summer in this part of the ocean, where
fresh provisions were abundant; and his men were relieved from the
hardships and sicknesses commonly incident to a long voyage, while, at
the same time, the shipâs stores were economized. He remained therefore
near three months among the Friendly Islands, using all means of
adding to the geographical knowledge of this intricate archipelago,
and acquiring information relative to the natural history of the country,
and the manners of the inhabitants, with whom an uninterrupted
friendship was maintained. July 17, Cook pursued his course to the
Society Islands. Both here and at the Friendly Islands, especially at
Otaheite, he left a number of European animals; and the prudence, as
well as benevolence, of this conduct, is evinced by the valuable supplies
which whalers and other navigators of the southern seas have since
drawn from them. Early in December he took a final leave of these
regions; and, January 18, 1778, came in sight of an unknown group,
to which he gave the name of Sandwich Islands. March 7, the west
coast of North America was seen; and after spending a month in
executing necessary repairs in Nootka Sound, the voyagers advanced
to the Aleutian Islands, and up Behringâs Strait. Here Cook ascertained
the continents of Asia and America to be only thirteen leagues
apart; and laid down the position of the most westerly point of America,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>just without the Arctic Circle, which he named Cape Prince of Wales.
August 18 he reached lat. 70Â° 44Â´, W. long. about 162Â°, his extreme
point, and continued to traverse those frozen regions till August 29,
when, the ice being daily increasing, it was time to seek a more genial
climate. But before proceeding to the south, he employed some time
in examining the coasts of Asia and America, and found reason to
admire the correctness of Behring, the discoverer of the strait which
bears that name. He passed the winter at the Sandwich Islands,
intending to return northward early enough to reach Kamtschatka by
the middle of May in the ensuing year.</p>

<p class='c000'>During this second visit was discovered the island of Owhyhee, the
largest and most important of the group, at which the strangers were
received with unusual generosity and confidence. Near ten weeks
were spent in sailing round it, without any serious disagreement
arising with the natives; and Cook ceased to regret that he had as
yet failed in meeting with a northern passage home. It is remarkable
that his Journal concludes with the following words: âTo this disappointment
we owed our having it in our power to revisit the Sandwich
Islands, and to enrich our voyage with a discovery, which though
the last, seemed in many respects to be the most important that had
hitherto been made by Europeans, throughout the extent of the
Pacific Ocean.â</p>

<p class='c000'>This island, which he had rejoiced so much to see, was the spot
where our great navigatorâs life was prematurely closed. We have the
testimony of an eye-witness to his own belief, that no premeditated
and treacherous assault had been planned; but that the fatal affray
was one of those accidents which human foresight cannot always
prevent. The natives of these, as of all the South Sea Islands, were
much addicted to stealing the new and tempting articles presented to
their view; a fault for which Captain Cook, with the benevolence
usually displayed in his dealings with them, has offered a charitable
and sensible apology. But on the night of February 13, one of the
shipâs boats was stolen. To recover this was a matter of importance;
and Cook went on shore, guarded only by a small number of marines,
hoping by amicable means to gain possession of the person of the king
of the district, which he had always found the most effectual method
of regaining stolen articles. The king consented to go on board the
Resolution; but a crowd collected, and indications of alarm and
hostility gradually increased, until blows were made at Captain Cook,
and he was obliged to fire in self-defence. A shower of stones was
then discharged at the marines, who returned it with a volley, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>this drew on the fire of the boatsâ crews. Cook turned round to stop
the firing, and order the boats to come close in to shore; but a rush
had been made on the marines as soon as their muskets were discharged,
and they were driven into the water, where four were killed,
the rest escaping to the boats. Cook was the last person left on shore;
and he was making for the pinnace, when an Indian came behind
him and struck him with a club. He sunk on one knee, and as he
rose was stabbed by another Indian in the neck. He fell into shallow
water within five or six yards of one of the boats; but there all was
confusion, and no united effort was made to save him. He struggled
vigorously, but was overcome by numbers; and at last was struck
down, not to rise again. His body, with the other slain, was abandoned
to the natives, and though every exertion was subsequently made,
nothing more than the bones, and not all of them, were recovered.
These were committed to the deep with military honours; honoured
more highly by the unfeigned sorrow of those who sailed under his
command.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Clerke, of the Discovery, succeeded to the command of the
expedition, and returned in the ensuing summer to the Polar Seas;
but he was unable to advance so far as in the former year. The chief
object of the voyage therefore failed. The ships returned along the
coast of Kamtschatka to Japan and China, and reached England in
October, 1780. Captain Clerke died of consumption in his second
visit to the Polar Seas, and Lieutenant King succeeded to the Discovery,
whose name is honourably associated with that of his great
commander, in consequence of his having continued the account of
the voyage, from the period at which Cookâs Journal ends. He has
borne testimony to Cookâs virtues in the following terms:â</p>

<p class='c000'>âThe constitution of his body was robust, inured to labour, and
capable of undergoing the severest hardships. His stomach bore
without difficulty the coarsest and most ungrateful food. Great was
the indifference with which he submitted to every kind of self-denial.
The qualities of his mind were of the same hardy, vigorous kind with
those of his body. His understanding was strong and perspicacious.
His judgment, in whatever related to the services he was engaged in,
quick and sure. His designs were bold and manly; and both in the
conception, and in the mode of execution, bore evident marks of a great
original genius. His courage was cool and determined, and accompanied
with an admirable presence of mind in the moment of danger.
His temper might, perhaps, have been justly blamed as subject to hastiness
and passion, had not these been disarmed by a disposition the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>benevolent and humane. Such were the outlines of Captain Cookâs
character; but its most distinguishing feature was that unremitting
perseverance in the pursuit of his object, which was not only superior
to the opposition of dangers, and the pressure of hardships, but even
exempt from the want of ordinary relaxation. During the long and
tedious voyages in which he was engaged, his eagerness and activity
were never in the least abated. No incidental temptation could detain
him for a moment: even those intervals of recreation which sometimes
unavoidably occurred, and were looked for by us with a longing, that
persons who have experienced the fatigues of service will readily
excuse, were submitted to by him with a certain impatience, whenever
they could not be employed in making a farther provision for the more
effectual prosecution of his designs.â</p>

<p class='c000'>The life of Captain Cook is, in effect, the history of his voyages, and
will best be found in the accounts of those works. But the memoir by
Dr. Kippis, the whole of which is printed in the Biographia Britannica,
is more adapted for general use. Samwellâs Narrative of the Death
of Captain Cook contains the fullest account of that lamentable event.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>TURGOT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Anne Robert James Turgot was born at Paris May 10, 1727.
He was descended from one of the oldest and most noble families
of Normandy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turgotâs childhood was passed under the superintendence of an
injudicious mother, whose affection for her son seems to have been
much lessened in consequence of his shy and awkward manners before
strangers. His father, on the contrary, was a man of sense and
humanity. He was Provost of the Corporation of Merchants, an
office which he long filled with deserved popularity. He lived till
1750, and by his example as well as by his precepts exerted no small
influence over the character of his son. If Turgotâs reserved and
silent manners are to be attributed to the one parent, the uprightness,
benevolence, and boldness of his conduct may perhaps in an
equal degree be ascribed to the other. At an early age he was sent
to the school of Louis le Grand, where he had little opportunity of
making progress; for the master though a kind-hearted man, was not
in other respects peculiarly qualified for his station. He afterwards
went to the school of Plessis. Here he was more fortunate in meeting
with two professors of superior abilities, GuÃ©rin and Sigorgne; the
latter honourably distinguished as being the first member of the universities
of France, who introduced the Newtonian philosophy into
the schools. Under their tuition, assisted by his own unremitting
assiduity, Turgot advanced rapidly, and the pupil soon acquired the
respect and friendship of his teachers.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the custom in France, during the period of Turgotâs boyhood,
that parents should decide upon the profession to which their
children should be educated, even from the cradle; little voice in this
most important question being allowed to those who were most deeply
interested in it. Turgot was the youngest of three sons; of whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the eldest was destined to the magistracy, the second to the army,
the third, the subject of this memoir, was set apart for the church.
The premature determination of his parents seemed amply justified as
his character was gradually developed. Great simplicity of manner,
pensiveness of mind, extreme diffidence and reserve, a distaste to dissipation
of any kind, habits of intense application, and an ardent love of
knowledge, were his prominent qualities, and well suited to the ecclesiastical
life. Nevertheless he had hardly reached the age of reflection,
and become capable of appreciating the objects of ambition, which,
from the political consideration in which his family was held, he
might reasonably aspire to, before he resolved to sacrifice all to an
unfettered conscience; and to follow that path in which he thought he
could be most useful to his fellow-citizens and mankind. Deeply
impressed however with a sense of what was due to the feelings of his
parents, he waited till a favourable opportunity should occur to disclose
his secret determination; and was in the mean time, at the age of
twenty-one, admitted to the establishment of the Sorbonne, as a student
of theology. Here he remained two years; prosecuting his studies with
vigour, but without confining them to a profession which he had resolved
not to follow. Nothing seemed too vast to discourage him, or too trifling
to escape his notice. Mathematics and natural philosophy, metaphysics,
logic, morals, legislation and law; history, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles lettres</span>, poetry, Latin,
Greek, Hebrew, together with most of the modern languages, entered
into the comprehensive catalogue of his pursuits. So great an activity
of mind, joined to a memory so retentive that he could repeat two
hundred lines of verse after hearing them read twice, and sometimes
only once, stored his mind with an extent and variety of knowledge
unusual at his, or indeed at any age. After taking his degree, and
being elected Prior of the establishment, he could no longer conceal
his intention of relinquishing the profession of the church. His
friends and associates, amongst others the AbbÃ©s Bon, Morellet, and
de Brienne, remonstrated with him in vain on his determination.
âFollow the advice,â he replied, âwhich you offer, since you are
able to do so: for my own part, it is impossible for me to wear a
mask all my life.â</p>

<p class='c000'>He had determined to pursue his fortune in the civil service of
the state; and his fatherâs death obviated the difficulties which might
have embarrassed him in carrying his resolution into effect. He
obtained the office of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Procureur du Roi</span> as a first step in his new
career, and soon after that of Master of Requests. In this situation
he had to make several reports, and to deliver them <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vivÃ¢ voce</span></i> before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>the King. Aware of his extreme diffidence, he resolved to counteract
it by writing out and revising his speech with great attention.
He did so; nothing was omitted, and yet the subject was
summed up with such severe conciseness as greatly to fatigue the
patience of his hearers. Some of them, complimenting him on his
performance, at the same time criticised its length. âThe next
time,â they added, âtry to abridge what you have to say.â Turgot,
who knew that it was impossible to have abridged more, learnt
by this remark that he had abridged too much; and on the next
occasion, profiting by his singularly acquired knowledge, he developed
his facts at length, repeated his arguments, and recapitulated all that he
had urged; and in doing so, fixed without fatiguing the attention of
his audience. When he had finished, the same friends, as he expected,
congratulated him warmly on having corrected his former defect,
saying, âThis time you have told us a great deal and you have been
very brief.â</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1761 he was made Intendant of Limoges; and on his appointment
Voltaire wrote to him, saying, âI have lately learnt from one
of your colleagues that an Intendant can do nothing but mischief:
you, I trust, will prove that he can do much good.â These anticipations
were fully realized. The inhabitants of his province, over-burthened
at all times by the oppressive imposts of the Taille, the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">CorvÃ©e</span>, and the Militia service, were then suffering under the added
pressure of three successive years of scarcity. The <em>Taille</em> was in the
nature of a land-tax: which fell upon the landlords in those parts of
the country which were cultivated by farmers; but principally upon the
labourers themselves, wherever the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MÃ©tayer</span></i> system was in force, as
in Limousin. A more equal distribution of this tax, and an improved
method of collection, relieved the peasant from the great injustice of
the burden. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">CorvÃ©e</span></i> was an obligation to furnish labour in kind,
twice every year, for the construction and repair of public roads; for
which the peasantry received no remuneration. Turgot proposed
that this task should for the future be executed by hired labourers,
whose wages were to be paid by a rate levied upon the districts
adjacent to the road. The evils of the Militia service were obviated
in a similar way; and the people who had received their new Intendant
with suspicion, as only a new specimen of their former oppressors,
now looked upon him as a benefactor and a friend. Nevertheless
his popularity could not overcome all prejudices; and when he
endeavoured to mitigate the evils occasioned by the late scarcity,
by introducing a free traffic in grain, both the magistrates and the
peasantry did all in their power to counteract his wise and benevolent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>exertions. In spite of his new regulations, supported by a clear
explanation of the grounds upon which they rested, the land-owners and
corn-merchants could not transport their grain to those places where
the price was highest, the want therefore most urgent, and the supply
most beneficial, without exposing their persons to insults, and their
property to the pillage of the people, as well as to the local taxes
imposed by the magistrates. Turgot lost no time in addressing a
circular to the proper officers, in which he urged them, by the pleas
both of reason and authority, to put in force the laws, and check
the popular irritation. He showed that the difference of weather
often produces an abundant harvest in some districts, and a deficient
one in others; and that the only effectual way of relieving the necessary
distress in the latter, is to permit the free transport of the
surplus produce of the former: that if one town were to arrogate the
right of prohibiting the transit or export of grain, other towns would
justly pretend to the same privilege; and that what might be felt
as a benefit to the inhabitants of one spot in a year of external
scarcity, would be deprecated by the same persons as a curse in a
year of internal famine. The clearness and conciliatory tone with
which the principle of the freedom of trade was laid down, produced
the desired effect; and the writer had the satisfaction of seeing the
wants of the people supplied, without recurring to the demoralizing
expedient of indiscriminate charity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after the success of this experiment, the Minister of Finance
consulted the Intendants of the kingdom upon the laws relating to
the commerce of grain. Turgot wrote seven letters in answer, in
which he developed at length his views on the subject of free trade;
and not long after he composed an essay on the Formation of
Wealth, which, as his celebrated biographer Condorcet observes, may
be considered as the germ of Smithâs Wealth of Nations.</p>

<p class='c000'>These unremitting exertions, joined to views so just and at that
time so original, attracted the attention of the public; and on the death
of Louis XV. Turgot was called to the first offices of the state, as the
only man who seemed likely to restore the failing credit of the nation,
do justice to the people, and prevent those political troubles which did
in fact ensue, and ended in confiscation and bloodshed. He undertook
the difficult task with cheerfulness, but not without some misgivings.
The aristocracy and the court could not long remain favourable to a
minister who would not cater to their luxuries; the clergy naturally
viewed with suspicion one who was devoted to the most rigid economy;
public opinion was not sufficiently advanced to appreciate the measures
of a statesman whose genius far surpassed the knowledge of his day;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>and even if it had been more enlightened, it had not the means of
expressing itself powerfully and almost simultaneously as in England.
Turgot therefore had no support to rely on but that of the King; but
while the monarch remained firm, there was still a hope that the statesman
might accomplish his objects. After filling the post of Minister
of Marine for one month, he was raised to the office of Minister of
Finance, August 24, 1774. Nothing could be more encouraging to
him than his first audience of the King; it was more like the confidential
intercourse of two friends considering in truth and sincerity
the best means of promoting the happiness of their common
country, than a cold and formal state conference. Turgot, with the
permission of his sovereign, recapitulated what had occurred at this
meeting, in a letter which is above all praise. In it he enforced
the absolute necessity of the most rigid economy, in order to prevent
a national bankruptcy, any increase of taxes, or any new loans. âNo
bankruptcy, either avowed, or disguised under compulsory reductions.
No increase of taxes. The reason your Majesty will find in the situation
of your people, and still more in your own heart. No new loans;
for every loan, by diminishing the free revenue, necessarily leads at
last to a bankruptcy or an increase of taxes.â The means by which
he proposed to bring about these ends were the most rigid retrenchments.
âBut,â he adds, âit is asked, in what is the retrenchment
to be made? and every department will maintain that as far as relates
to itself there is scarcely a single expense which is not indispensable.
The reasons alleged may be very good; but as there can be none for
performing impossibilities, all these reasons must give way to the
irresistible necessity of economy. Your Majesty knows that one
of the greatest obstacles to economy is the multitude of solicitations
to which you are perpetually exposed. Your benevolence, Sir,
must be the shield against your bounty. Consider whence the
money distributed amongst your courtiers is drawn; and contrast the
misery of those from whom it is sometimes necessary to wrest it by
the most rigorous measures, with the situation of those who have the
best title to your liberality.â Such a course was sure to raise up
enemies on every side. He anticipates the calumnies which will be
heaped upon him; he points them out to the King, and then reminds
him, âIt is upon the faith of your Majestyâs promises that I take upon
myself a burthen which is perhaps heavier than I can bear; it is to
yourself personally, to the honest, the just, and the good man, rather
than to the King, that I devote myself.â</p>

<p class='c000'>From this letter it might be supposed by those who are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>acquainted with all Turgotâs principles, that his first step would be
to stop the payment to every useless pensioner upon the state, and
abrogate every local tax which had been unjustly levied by individuals
in times of anarchy and oppression. But he respected the right
of property; and the more so, because he understood its full extent.
Every unjust impost was indeed taken off, and every monopoly
destroyed; but not without first giving to the possessors an indemnification
equal to their loss: and two yearsâ arrears of pensions, which
had been stopped for three years previous to his entering upon office,
were punctually discharged without loss of time where the amount
was small, and the creditor therefore in all probability not in affluent
circumstances; whilst the payment of the remaining ones was accelerated
as much as possible. It was not therefore by injustice that he
endeavoured to relieve the people, but by enabling them more easily
to bear their burdens. The faithful discharge of all claims upon the
state, restored the credit of the country; the destruction of monopolies,
and of restrictions upon commerce and manufactures, increased the
wealth of the people, and thus rendered comparatively light an amount
of taxation which was before most burdensome. Thus, his first regulations
established a free trade in corn throughout the kingdom, and
took away the exclusive privileges of bakers, the obligation to grind
corn at particular mills, and several market dues upon corn when sold.
A similar edict permitted the free circulation of wine; and brandy,
cider, and perry were meant to have been subsequently included in this
law. The manufacturers of France were also freed from the absurd
and vexatious regulations which prescribed the size of different stuffs,
and the method of making and dying them, under severe penalties and
even corporal punishments; and ingenuity was allowed to exert itself
according to the taste and demand of the public. Glass, powder,
saltpetre, nitre, oil of poppies, and many other articles, were either
freed on the one hand from the exclusive privileges in their manufacture,
which enhanced their price and interfered with their quality;
or on the other, from restrictions upon their free transport through
the kingdom, which prevented the manufacturer from obtaining the
best price for his goods.</p>

<p class='c000'>These changes were brought about in little more than a year and a
half, during which his labours were interrupted by attacks of illness,
and by two events which could not be averted or foreseen. The
first of these was a contagious disorder which broke out among the
cattle of Guienne, and spread far and wide, until the salutary measures
taken by Turgot arrested the evil: the other was more serious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>and required all the decision and courage of the minister for its
suppression. The season had been unfavourable; and in times of
scarcity the people had been accustomed to vent their fury against the
corn-merchants, whom the government often weakly abandoned. A
repetition of these scenes was approaching. A few riots in the provincial
towns were soon quelled, but a heavier storm impended
over the capital. A band of lawless insurgents, after plundering
the corn-markets upon the Seine and Oise, entered Paris, rifled
many bakersâ shops, and endeavoured to excite the people to outrage
and violence. The powers of government seemed paralysed.
The superintendents of the police were frightened and inactive;
and the parliament published a proclamation, promising that the
King should be petitioned for a reduction in the price of bread.
Turgot lost no time in sending troops to the disturbed district, who
soon dispersed the pillagers; the superintendents of the police were
immediately dismissed from office; and government proclamations
were posted over those of the parliament during the very night in
which the latter were issued, prohibiting the assembling of the
people on pain of death. These energetic and salutary measures soon
restored tranquillity and confidence; the property of the merchants
was respected; and the price of provisions found the lowest level
which the nature of the case would admit of. A month after, the
King in passing through a district in which these riots had prevailed,
was cheered by subjects who blessed his government. âIt is Turgot
and I alone who love the people,â was the expression which fell from
his lips; and the sentence was repeated and confirmed by a nationâs
voice. In spite, however, of Turgotâs indefatigable and honest
exertions in the cause of his country, his dismission from office was
soon demanded. The privileged orders insisted upon remaining
exempt from the payment of the taxes; the court parasites upheld the
necessity of sinecures and pensions; all who lived upon the resources
of the country without serving it, united in denouncing a minister who
was the friend of the people and of justice; nor had the clergy any
sympathy with one who laid down the most comprehensive principles
of toleration. The King had the culpable weakness of yielding to
this dishonest clamour. He sacrificed his minister, and not many years
after died himself upon the scaffold; that scaffold which was destined
to reek with the blood of his family, his friends, and his subjects.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turgot had been in office only twenty months, but during that time
he had prepared the way for a new era of extensive happiness and
prosperity for his fellow-countrymen. A friend reproached him one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>day with being too precipitate. âHow can you say so,â he replied,
âyou who know so well the pressing wants of the people, and are
aware that none of my family survive the gout beyond the age of fifty.â
His prediction was but too nearly fulfilled; he died of this hereditary
disease a few years afterwards, March 20, 1781, in the fifty-fourth
year of his age.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the interval between his retiring from office, and his death,
Turgot devoted himself to literary and scientific pursuits. His works
are contained in nine volumes octavo, 1808â11; they are composed
principally of state papers connected with his administration, of some
articles written for the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">EncyclopÃ©die</span>, and a few translations from
classical and modern literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turgot was a great and a good man; endowed with depth and
originality of thought, he discovered and acted upon sound principles of
political economy, before the science had been even dignified with a
name; and whilst his predecessors in office were ever seeking for
temporary expedients to increase the revenue of the state by the
oppression of the people, he first endeavoured to unite the interests of
both. Mild and conciliating in his manners, just and benevolent in all
his viewâs, he was the firm and uncompromising opponent of every
species of injustice. He was ambitious, but his ambition was of the
highest order. He despised the tinsel grandeur of office, the smiles of
courtiers, or even the applause of the multitude; but he courted the
means of doing good to mankind, and his reward has been the
esteem of discerning friends and the applause of a later and a more
enlightened age.</p>

<p class='c000'>A disquisition on the life and opinions of Turgot, by Dupont de
Nemours, is prefixed to the edition of his works which we have
already mentioned. His life, written by Condorcet, is one of the
best specimens of biography in any language. Lacretelleâs â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire
du dix-huitiÃ¨me SiÃ¨cle</span>â contains a short sketch of his ministry,
well deserving attention: and several interesting details of his character
are to be found in the Memoirs of the AbbÃ© Morellet.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>PETER the GREAT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>At the close of the sixteenth century, the dominions of Russia, or
Muscovy, as it was then more generally called, were far thrown back
from the more civilized nations of southern Europe, by the intervention
of Lithuania, Livonia, and other provinces now incorporated in
the Russian empire, but then belonging either to Sweden or Poland.
The Czar of Muscovy therefore possessed no political weight in the
affairs of Europe; and little intercourse existed between the Court of
Moscow and the more polished potentates whom it affected to despise
as barbarians, even for some time after the accession of the reigning
dynasty, the house of Romanof, in 1613, and the establishment of a
more regular government than had previously been known. We only
read occasionally of embassies being sent to Moscow, in general for the
purpose of arranging commercial relations. From this state of insignificance,
Peter, the first Emperor of Russia, raised his country, by introducing
into it the arts of peace, by establishing a well organized and
disciplined army in the place of a lawless body of tumultuous mutineers,
by creating a navy, where scarce a merchant vessel existed before, and,
as the natural result of these changes, by important conquests on
both the Asiatic and European frontiers of his hereditary dominions.
For these services his countrymen bestowed on him, yet
living, the title of Great: and it is well deserved, whether we look
to the magnitude of those services, the difficulty of carrying into effect
his benevolent designs, which included nothing less than the remodelling
a whole people, or the grasp of mind, and the iron energy
of will, which was necessary to conceive such projects, and to overcome
the difficulties which beset them. It will not vitiate his claim to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the epithet, that his manners were coarse and boisterous, his amusements
often ludicrous and revolting to a polished taste: if that claim
be questionable, it is because he who aspired to be the reformer of
others, was unable to control the violence of his own passions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Czar Alexis, Peterâs father, was actuated by somewhat of the
spirit which so distinguished the son. He endeavoured to introduce
the European discipline into his armies; he had it much at heart to
turn the attention of the Russians to maritime pursuits; and he added
the fine provinces of Plescow and Smolensko to his paternal dominions.
At the death of Alexis, in 1677, Peter was but five years
old. His eldest brother Theodore succeeded to the throne. Theodore
died after a reign of five years, and named Peter his successor. We
pass in silence over the intrigues and insurrections which troubled
the young Czarâs minority. It was not until the close of the year
1689, in the eighteenth year of his age, that he finally shook off the
trammels of an ambitious sister, and assumed in reality, as well as in
name, the direction of the state. How he had been qualified for this
task by education does not clearly appear; but even setting aside the
stories which attribute to his sister the detestable design of leading
him into all sorts of excess, and especially drunkenness, with the hope
of ruining both his constitution and intellect, it is probable that no
pains whatever had been taken to form his intellect or manners for
the station which he was to occupy. One of the few anecdotes told of
his early life is, that being struck by the appearance of a boat on the
river Yausa, which runs through Moscow, which he noticed to be of
different construction from the flat-bottomed vessels commonly in use,
he was led to inquire into the method of navigating it. It had been
built for the Czar Alexis by a Dutchman, who was still in Moscow.
He was immediately sent for; he rigged and repaired the boat; and
under his guidance the young prince learnt how to sail her, and soon
grew passionately fond of his new amusement. He had five small
vessels built at Plescow, on the lake Peipus; and not satisfied with
this fresh-water navigation, hired a ship at Archangel, in which he
made a voyage to the coast of Lapland. In these expeditions his
love of sailing was nourished into a passion which lasted through
life. He prided himself upon his practical skill as a seaman; and
both at this time and afterwards exposed himself and his friends to no
small hazard by his rashness in following this favourite pursuit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first serious object of Peterâs attention was to reform the army.
In this he was materially assisted by a Swiss gentleman named
Lefort; at whose suggestion he raised a company of fifty men, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>were clothed and disciplined in the European manner; the Russian
army at that time being little better than a tribe of Tartars. As soon
as the little corps was formed, Peter caused himself to be enrolled in
it as a private soldier. It is a remarkable trait in the character of the
man, that he thought no condescension degrading, which forwarded
any of his ends. In the army he entered himself in the lowest rank,
and performed successively the duties of every other: in the navy he
went still further, for he insisted on performing the menial duties of
the lowest cabin-boy, rising step by step, till he was qualified to rate
as an able seaman. Nor was this done merely for the sake of singularity;
he had resolved that every officer of the sea or land service
should enter in the lowest rank of his profession, that he might
obtain a practical knowledge of every task or manÅuvre which
it was his duty to see properly executed: and he felt that his
nobility might scarcely be brought to submit to what in their eyes
would be a degradation, except by the personal example of the Czar
himself. By the help of Lefort and some veteran officers, several
of whom, and those the objects of his especial confidence, were
Scotchmen, he was enabled in a short time to command the services
of a large body of disciplined troops, composed, one corps principally
of foreigners, another of natives. Meanwhile he had not been negligent
of the other arm of war; for a number of Dutch and Venetian
workmen were employed in building gun-boats and small ships of war
at Voronitz, on the river Don, intended to secure the command of
the sea of Asof, and to assist in capturing the strong town of Asof,
then held by the Turks. The possession of this place was of great
importance, from its situation at the mouth of the Don, commanding
access to the Mediterranean seas. His first military attempts were
accordingly directed against it, and he succeeded in taking it in 1696.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the spring of the ensuing year, the empire being tranquil, and
the young Czarâs authority apparently established on a safe footing, he
determined to travel into foreign countries, to view with his own eyes,
and become personally and practically familiar with the arts and institutions
of refined nations. There was a grotesqueness in his manner
of executing this design, which has tended, more probably than even
its real merit, to make it one of the common places of history. Every
child knows how the Czar of Muscovy worked in the dock-yard of
Saardam in Holland, as a common carpenter. In most men this
would have been affectation; and perhaps there was some tinge of
that weakness in the earnestness with which Peter handled the axe,
obeyed the officers of the dock-yard, and, in all points of outward manners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>and appearance, put himself on a level with the shipwrights who
were earning their daily bread. Most men too would have thought it
unnecessary, that a prince, intent upon creating a navy, should learn
the mere mechanical art of putting a ship together; and that his time
would have been better employed in studying the sciences connected
with navigation, and the discipline and details of the naval service as
established in the best schools. It seems, however, to have been the
turn of Peterâs mind always to begin at the beginning; a sound maxim,
though here perhaps pushed beyond reasonable bounds. We have
said, that he scrupulously went through the lowest services in the
army and navy: probably he thought it as necessary that one who
aimed at creating and directing a navy should not be ignorant of the
practical art of ship-building, as that a general should be capable of
performing himself the movements which he directs the private to
execute. And his abode and occupations in Holland formed only part
of an extensive plan. On quitting Russia he sent sixty young
Russians to Venice and Leghorn to learn ship-building and navigation,
and especially the construction and management of the large
galleys moved by oars, which were so much used by the Venetian
republic. Others he sent into Holland, with similar instructions;
others into Germany, to study the art of war, and make themselves
well acquainted with the discipline and tactics of the German troops.
So that while his personal labour at Saardam may have been stimulated
in part by affectation of singularity, in part perhaps by a love of
bodily exertion common in men of his busy and ardent temper, it
would be unjust not to give him credit for higher motives; such as the
desire to become thoroughly acquainted with the art of ship-building,
which he thought so important, and to set a good example of diligence
to those whom he had sent out on a similar voyage of education.</p>

<p class='c000'>Peter remained nine months in Holland, the greatest part of which
he spent in the dock-yard of Saardam. He displayed unwearied zeal
in seeking out and endeavouring to comprehend every thing of interest
in science and art, especially in visiting manufactories. In January,
1698, he sailed for London in an English man-of-war, sent out expressly
to bring him over. His chief object was to perfect himself in the
higher branches of ship-building. With this view he occupied Mr.
Evelynâs house, adjoining the dock-yard of Deptford; and there
remain in that gentlemanâs journal some curious notices of the manners
of the Czar and his household, which were of the least refined
description. During his stay he showed the same earnestness in
inquiring into all things connected with the maritime and commercial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>greatness of the country, as before in Holland; and he took away near
five hundred persons in his suite, consisting of naval captains, pilots,
gunners, surgeons, and workmen in various trades, especially those
connected with the naval service. In England, without assuming his
rank, he ceased to wear the attire and adopt the habits of a common
workman; and he had frequent intercourse with William III., who
is said to have conceived a strong liking for him, notwithstanding the
uncouthness of his manners. Kneller painted a portrait of him for
the King, said to be a good likeness, from which our print is engraved.</p>

<p class='c000'>He left London in April, 1698, and proceeded to Vienna, principally
to inspect the Austrian troops, then esteemed among the best in
Europe. He had intended to visit Italy; but his return was hastened
by the tidings of a dangerous insurrection having broken out, which,
though suppressed, seemed to render a longer absence from the seat
of government inexpedient. The insurgents were chiefly composed
of the Russian soldiery, abetted by a large party who thought every
thing Russian good, and hated and dreaded the Czarâs innovating
temper. Of those who had taken up arms, many were slain
in battle; the rest, with many persons of more rank and consequence,
suspected of being implicated in the revolt, were retained in
prison until the Czar himself should decide their fate. Numerous
stories of his extravagant cruelties on this occasion have been told,
which may safely be passed over as unworthy of credit. It is certain,
however, that considerable severity was shown. Many citizens who
had not borne arms were condemned to death as instigators of the
rebellion, and their frozen bodies exposed on the gibbets, or thrown
by the way-side, remained throughout the winter, a fearful spectacle
to passers by. In some accounts it is stated that two thousand of the
soldiery were put to death: but the absurd falsehoods told of Peterâs
conduct on this occasion afford opportunity for a doubt, which we
gladly entertain, whether justice was suffered to lead to such wholesale
butchery. This insurrection led to the complete remodelling of
the Russian army, on the same plan which had already been partially
adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the year 1699 the Czar was chiefly occupied by civil
reforms. According to his own account, as published in his journal,
he regulated the press, caused translations to be published of various
treatises on military and mechanical science, and history; he founded
a school for the navy; others for the study of the Latin, German, and
other languages; he encouraged his subjects to cultivate foreign trade,
which before they had absolutely been forbidden to do under pain of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>death; he altered the Russian calendar, in which the year began on
September 1, to agree in that point with the practice of other nations;
he broke through the Oriental custom of not suffering women to mix
in general society; and he paid sedulous attention to the improvement
of his navy on the river Don. We have the testimony of Mr. Deane,
an English ship-builder, that the Czar had turned his manual labours
to good account, who states in a letter to England, that âthe Czar
has set up a ship of sixty guns, where he is both foreman and master
builder; and, not to flatter him, Iâll assure your Lordship, it will
be the best ship among them, and it is all from his own draught: how
he framed her together, and how he made the moulds, and in so short
a time as he did, is really wonderful.â</p>

<p class='c000'>He introduced an improved breed of sheep from Saxony and
Silesia; despatched engineers to survey the different provinces of his
extensive empire; sent persons skilled in metallurgy to the various
districts in which mines were to be found; established manufactories
of arms, tools, stuffs; and encouraged foreigners skilled in the
useful arts to settle in Russia, and enrich it by the produce of their
industry.</p>

<p class='c000'>We cannot trace the progress of that protracted contest between
Sweden and Russia, in which the short-lived greatness of Sweden was
broken: we can only state the causes of the war, and the important
results to which it led. Peterâs principal motive for engaging in it
was his leading wish to make Russia a maritime and commercial
nation. To this end it was necessary that she should be possessed
of ports, of which however she had none but Archangel and Asof,
both most inconveniently situated, as well in respect of the Russian
empire itself, as of the chief commercial nations of Europe. On the
waters of the Baltic Russia did not possess a foot of coast. Both sides
of the Baltic, both sides of the Gulf of Finland, the country between the
head of that gulf and the lake Ladoga, including both sides of the river
Neva, and the western side of lake Ladoga itself, and the northern end
of lake Peipus, belonged to Sweden. In the year 1700, Charles XII.
being but eighteen years of age, Denmark, Poland, and Russia,
which had all of them suffered from the ambition of Sweden, formed
a league to repair their losses, presuming on the weakness usually
inherent in a minority. The object of Russia was the restoration of
the provinces of Ingria, Carelia, and Wiborg, the country round the
head of the Gulf of Finland, which formerly had belonged to her; that
of Poland, was the recovery of Livonia and Esthonia, the greater part
of which had been ceded by her to Charles XI. of Sweden. Denmark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>was to obtain Holstein and Sleswick. But Denmark and Poland
very soon withdrew, and left Russia to encounter Sweden single-handed.
To this she was entirely unequal; her army, the bulk of
it undisciplined, and even the disciplined part unpractised in the
field, was no match for the veteran troops of Sweden, the terror of
Germany. In the battle of Narva, a town on the river which runs
out of the Peipus lake, fought November 30, 1700, nine thousand
Swedes defeated signally near forty thousand Russians, strongly
intrenched and with a numerous artillery. Had Charles prosecuted
his success with vigour, he might probably have delayed for many
years the rise of Russia; but whether from contempt or mistake he
devoted his whole attention to the war in Poland, and left the Czar at
liberty to recruit and discipline his army, and improve the resources of
his kingdom. In these labours he was most diligent. His troops, practised
in frequent skirmishes with the Swedes quartered in Ingria and
Livonia, rapidly improved, and on the celebrated field of Pultowa broke
for ever the power of Charles XII. This decisive action did not take
place until July 8, 1709. The interval was occupied by a series of
small, but important additions to the Russian territory. In 1701â2,
great part of Livonia and Ingria were subdued, including the banks
of the Neva, where, on May 27, 1703, the city of St. Petersburg was
founded. It was not till 1710 that the conquest of Courland, with the
remainder of Livonia, including the important harbours of Riga and
Revel, gave to Russia that free navigation of the Baltic sea which Peter
had longed for as the greatest benefit which he could confer upon his
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the battle of Pultowa Charles fled to Turkey, where he
continued for some years, shut out from his own dominions, and intent
chiefly on spiriting the Porte to make war on Russia. In this he
succeeded; but hostilities were terminated almost at their beginning,
by the battle of the Pruth, fought July 20, 1711, in which the Russian
army, not mustering more than forty thousand men, and surrounded by
five times that number of Turks, owed its preservation to Catharine,
first the mistress, at this time the wife, and finally the acknowledged
partner and successor of Peter in the throne of Russia. By her coolness
and prudence, while the Czar, exhausted by fatigue, anxiety, and
self-reproach, was labouring under nervous convulsions, to which he
was liable throughout life, a treaty was concluded with the Vizier in
command of the Turkish army, by which the Russians preserved indeed
life, liberty, and honour, but were obliged to resign Asof, to give up
the forts and burn the vessels built to command the sea bearing that
name, and to consent to other stipulations, which must have been very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>bitter to the hitherto successful conqueror. Returning to the seat of
government, his foreign policy for the next few years was directed to
breaking down the power of Sweden, and securing his new metropolis
by prosecuting his conquests on the northern side of the Gulf of
Finland. Here he was entirely successful; and the whole of Finland
itself, and of the gulf, fell into his hands. These provinces were
secured to Russia by the peace of Nieustadt, in 1721. Upon this
occasion, the senate or state assembly of Russia requested him to
assume the title of Emperor of all the Russias, with the adjuncts of
Great, and Father of his Country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the private history and character of Peter, we have hitherto
said nothing. He was passionately fond of ardent spirits, and not only
drank very largely himself, but took a pleasure in compelling others
to do the same, until the royal banqueting-room became a scene of
the most revolting debauchery and intoxication. But towards the close
of life, his habits, when alone, were temperate even to abstemiousness.
In his domestic relations he was far from happy. At the age of
seventeen he married a Russian lady, named Eudoxia Lapouchin,
whom he divorced in less than three years. According to some accounts,
this separation was caused by her infidelities; according to
others, by her obstinate hostility to all his projects of improvement: a
hostility inculcated and encouraged by the priesthood, in whose eyes all
change was an abomination, and the worst of changes those made professedly
in imitation of the barbarous nations inhabiting the rest of
Europe. By her the Czar had one son, Alexis, heir to the throne; who,
under the guardianship of his weak and bigoted mother, grew up in the
practice of all low debauchery, and with the same deference to the
priesthood, and dislike to change, which had cost herself the society of
her husband. The degeneracy of this, his eldest, and long his only son,
was a serious affliction to Peter; the more so, if he reflected justly,
because he could not hold himself guiltless of it, in having intrusted the
education of his legitimate successor to one, of whose incapacity for
the charge he had ample proof. It appears from authentic documents
that even so early as the battle of the Pruth, Peter had contemplated
the necessity of excluding his son from the throne. In the close of the
year 1716, he addressed a serious expostulation to Alexis, in which,
after reviewing the errors of his past life, he declared his fixed intention
of cutting off the prince from the succession, unless he should so
far amend as to afford a reasonable hope of his reigning for the good
of his people. He required him either to work a thorough reformation
in his life and manners, or to retire to a monastery; and allowed him
six months to deliberate upon this alternative. At the end of the time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Alexis quitted Russia, under pretence of going to his father at Copenhagen;
but instead of doing so he fled to Vienna. He was induced,
however, to return by promises of forgiveness, mixed with threats in
the event of his continued disobedience, and arrived at Moscow,
February 13, 1718. On the following day the clergy, the chief officers
of state, and the chief nobility were convened, and Alexis, being brought
before them as a prisoner, acknowledged himself unworthy of the succession,
which he resigned, entreating only that his life might be spared.
A declaration was then read on the part of the Czar, reciting the various
delinquencies of which his son had been guilty, and ending with
the solemn exclusion of him from the throne, and the nomination of
Peter, his own infant son by Catharine, as the future emperor. To
this solemn act of renunciation Alexis set his hand. Thus far there
is nothing to blame in the parentâs conduct, unless it be considered
that in the promise of forgiveness, a reservation of his sonâs
hereditary right was implied. His subsequent conduct was severe, if
not faithless. Not content with what had been done, Peter determined
to extract from Alexis a full confession of the plans which he had
entertained, and of the names of his advisers. For near five months
the wretched young man was harassed by constant interrogatories,
in his replies to which considerable prevarication took place. It was
on the ground of this prevarication that, in July, 1718, the Czar
determined to bring his son to trial. By the laws of Russia a father
had power of life or death over his child, and the Czar absolute power
over the lives of his subjects. Waving these rights, however, if such
oppressive privileges deserve the name, he submitted the question to
an assembly of the chief personages of the realm; and the document
which he addressed to them on this occasion bears strong evidence to
the honesty of his purpose, unfeeling as that purpose must appear.
On July 5, that assembly unanimously pronounced Alexis worthy of
death, and on the next day but one Alexis died. The manner of his
death will never probably be entirely cleared up. Rumour of course
attributed it to violence; but there are many circumstances which
render this improbable. One argument against it is to be found in
the character of Peter himself, who would hardly have hesitated to
act this tragedy in the face of the world, had he thought it necessary
to act it at all. Why he should have incurred the guilt of an action
scarce one degree removed from midnight murder, when the object
might have been effected by legal means, and the odium was already
incurred, it is not easy to say. He courted publicity for his conduct,
and submitted himself to the judgment of Europe, by causing the
whole trial to be translated into several languages, and printed. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>own statement intimates that he had not intended to enforce the
sentence; and proceeds to say that on July 6, Alexis, after having heard
the judgment read, was seized by fits resembling apoplexy, and died
the following day; having seen his father and received his forgiveness,
together with the last rites of the Greek religion. This is the less
improbable, because intemperance had injured the princeâs constitution,
and a tendency to fits was hereditary in the family.</p>

<p class='c000'>If our sketch of the latter years of Peterâs life appear meagre and
unsatisfactory, it is to be recollected that the history of that life is the
history of a great empire, which it would be vain to condense within
our limits, were they greater than they are. Results are all that we
are competent to deal with. From the peace of Nieustadt, the exertions
of Peter, still unremitting, were directed more to consolidate
and improve the internal condition of the empire, by watching over
the changes which he had already made, than to effect farther conquests,
or new revolutions in policy or manners. He died February 8, 1725,
leaving no surviving male issue. Sometime before, he had caused the
Empress Catharine to be solemnly crowned and associated with him
on the throne, and to her he left the charge of fostering those schemes
of civilization which he had originated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the numerous works which treat wholly or in part of the history
of Peter the Great, that of Voltaire, not the most trustworthy, is probably
the most widely known. Fuller information will be found in
the â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Pierre le Grand, ecrit par lui-mÃªme</span>;â in the memoirs
published under the name of Nestesuranoi, and the Anecdotes of
M. StÃ¦hlin. For English works, we may refer to Tookeâs History of
Russia, and the âLife of Peter,â in the Family Library.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
